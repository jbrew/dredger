 Love the product, but I dislike the flavor. It's almost a sweet minty taste. I wish it weren't so slippery. Like that it retains its "tape" shape, unlike other tapes that roll into floss when cleaning teeth; and that it glides very easily.  But it is very harsh on gums.  I wouldn't buy it again. Mint flavor is a little icky (dentist mint flavor). Will get plain next time. However the actual floss works really well and does not shred. I like glide floss.  Dentist says you have to be careful to pay attention as this will glide over plaque - as long as you know that you are good. I thought I like at first.  It is thick enough and moves freely between the teeth but darn it, keeps breaking.  I am going to try another brand. these break easily I like this brand, but my dentist asked that I switch back to normal floss, saying that he thought that it did a better job. My teeth are tight and this goes in well but can get stringy and break. Much prefer the original. The ribbon shreds pretty easily. Otherwise it's not so bad I guess. I wouldn't buy it ever again.
