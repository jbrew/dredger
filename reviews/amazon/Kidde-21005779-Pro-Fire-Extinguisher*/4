   It appears to be a nicely made fire extinguisher.  I would have bought the next level up, but that one was about 25 lbs.  That may be too big and heavy for some people in my household.  Buy an extinguisher.  They really can save your life. I'm happy to report that mine arrived fully assembled, fully charged, nothing was broken.I contacted the manufacturer to see how safe it would be for this thing to be in a hot car.  After asking and explaining my question twice to the woman, she finally settled on 100 degrees, but didn't know if that was Celsius or Fahrenheit.  I wouldn't count on this company providing any service whatsoever.You may find this link informative, as it provides more information on minimum heat tolerance for UL Listed fire extinguishers.articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/26/news/hw-48106 Smaller than expected.  Doesn't look like its worth recharging.  Hope we never need to use it but it should do the job. The only drawback is it worked only for few mins. I guess you have to buy a big one for real emergency. Have not used it. But it seems to be able to handle a fire if needed, I purchased this as a gift for my father, so that he could have an extra fire extinguisher for our garage. Ironically, a week after we received this,  our friend's garage burnt to the ground when petrol fumes ignited, so as it turns out his paranoia about having 4 fire extinguishers in one room may be well justified after all. We haven't had to use it, but given our range of flammable projects and materials in the garage, I am confident this will do the job should it ever need to be broken out. Thankfully, I haven't had a chance to test this fire extinguisher, but I am deducting a star because the wall mount did not come with screws and drywall anchors.  It's still sitting on the floor in my pantry, because I haven't gotten around to finding the supplies needed to attach it to the wall.  On the other hand, it does come with a giant red sticker to let everyone know where the fire extinguisher is. This is good to have at home in case of emergency. I have not used it yet but based on the descriptions and the reviews that I read here, I believe that this product is reliable and functionable. Luckily I haven't had to use this yet, BUT it is a very hefty unit, and from looks alone I'm pleased with the product.  I hope not to have to update my review after a fire... Beefy extinguisher for my truck.  Much better capacity and fire suppression than a 10bc.  Didn't care for the tiny metal wall mount.  The old ones came with sturdier mounts.        Seems fine. Have not used it and hopefully will never have to but its good to know its readily available. Looks great. However, since I haven't really used it, I cannot give it a 5-star rating yet. Good size. Haven't needed to use it thankfully. I keep it on my bedroom for emergencies. Seems to be well made and gives peace of mind that we can stop minor fires. Looks sturdy, mounted easily, luckily have not had the need to test it out. ok Nothing special, serves its purpose, got what I needed. i am not used this item yet. but looks good Compact and I'm ready for a fire emergency! I hope I never find out if I love it:)  Very good to have one. Works well. Quality Easy instructions.  Haven't had to use it yet, but it seems like it would be easy to use.  Went over instructions with the rest of the family, and everybody seemed to get them Hard to review given I have not used the product, which I hope to avoid.  Heavier than other kitchen extinguishers.  We keep this one upstairs and closeby in the event of an emergency. I LIKE THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER, BUT I WISH IT WERE A LITTLE LARGER IN SIZE, JUST HOPE IT WILL WORK GOOD IF I EVER NEED TO USE IT
