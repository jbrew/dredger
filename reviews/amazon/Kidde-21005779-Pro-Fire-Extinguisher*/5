 My kids are home this summer while I'm at work, so this is for them. My oldest is trained to use it and she can easily, but it is surprising my 7 year old son can handle it as well. The sticker is big too. They all know P A S S. Get one for your kitchen. And, a lot of fire departments will demo for the kids and train them Saved my house .  Performed perfect. One thousand stars!  I recommend this for everyone . We could have never put out the fire without it . Easy to use . Already bought the same to replace it . It does say though it is rechargable but I wanted it right away .Thanks Kidde ! How do you rate a fire extinguisher without actually having used it on a fire?  I gave it five stars on the basis of its solid construction, excellent yet simple instructions, its very appearance which inspires confidence, and the fact that I have seen this same model in doctors' offices and other businesses, which means probably that it was recommended or chosen by their insurance inspectors.I hope I never have occasion to report how it performs in use. Its a Fire Extinguisher, or at least i hope it is...Only time will tell.The gauge says its full and ready to go.If the day came where i need to use it, ill be sure to update my review should this actually be a mis branded gasoline sprayer.Just kidding,Be smart and safe Are you really going to buy a disposable fire extinguisher that begins to lose the ability to fight a fire-right after you buy it? Or are you going to buy piece of mind and be able to purchase one fire extinguisher to rule them all? I spent the extra money to buy a reusable/repressurable (ok, that's not a word) fire extinguisher.  I'm on my third home and each time we've left the old fire extinguisher stayed behind, cause it no longer was of optimum pressure and couldn't be refilled.  There is a race to the bottom to make cheap products, that has a place, but I don't want to replace another fire extinguisher.  The Kiddie Pro 210 is the least expensive and smallest rechargeable extinguisher I could find. Kidde also has a resource on their site where they tell you where you can take your fire extinguisher to re-pressurize it when it looses pressure, which will happen in a few years. Never had to use it, but helps with home owners insurance costs. And pease of mind! Just knowing it's there is a plus for us. Every home or apartment should have one on the wall or just in the house. The garage is another good area to put one. Again, reduces insurance costs. This bad boy was very effective in putting out the fire I had caused on my grill (haven't cleaned out the fat deposits on the bottom of the grill for a while). The fire was quite scary, but one blow from this canister and no more fire almost instantly. Afterwards, just a couple of hours of cleaning up the mess I made in the grill. I'm a fire protection engineer. How much is your life worth? A fire in a residential occupancy doubles in size every minute. You realistically have a minute to put out the fire and if you fail, you have 3 minutes to leave with your life. Give yourself the best chance of winning and surviving...buy it. I already have three of these and decided to get two more - one for our master bedroom and another for the garage.  These extinguishers are well made with brass valves and powder coated aluminum cylinders which makes the overall weigh of 7.5 pounds easy to use.  A plastic wall mounting bracket comes with the extinguisher.  Each extinguisher holds 4 pounds of extinguishing agent (monoammonium phosphate) that should discharge for 13 to 15 seconds and is effective on all types of small fires from a distance of 10-15 feet.  The dry powder extinguishing agent will leave a mess when used, but that's a small price to pay to save a life or your home.  You might want to check with your local servicing company about refilling costs as it may be cheaper just to buy a new one even though these are designed to be refilled. What can I say, its a fire extinguisher that works on electrical, gas, and chemical fires within the home. We had a kitchen fire and if it had not been for the purchase of one of these, the fire might have gotten out of control. Now, It's a must. I have fire extinguishers for the kitchen, family room, and an upstairs room with computer equipment. We also have fire alarms in various places.  Typical Kidde quality and product.  Great.  Needed one, and this fit the bill, was delivered quickly and saved me some bucks.If you're looking for a good extinguisher of this type, get this one.  I've used them before and never been disappointed. After discharging my original extinguisher on a neighbors kitchen fire I found this unit to be a satisfactory replacement. These are NOT toys, Fire Extinguishers are tools. Read the directions BEFORE you need to use one. Damage Control requires training, skill and protection from God Himself. The simple byproduct of smoke from a fire can kill you before you attempt your next breath. Know your limitations, plan your reactions and keep safety first. This is not a product where an amateur can simply pick up and fly by the seat of their pants, professional training is good advice for those who want to be successful in living after an event that requires the use of one of these. arrive in good shape. Manufacture date is 2016 so this is a new item. and needle point straight in the middle of the green triangle so this is properly charged. Comes with a mounting bracket and 'escape' arrow sign. Also with a tag for inspections.  The head and all the important parts are metal not cheap plastic.PS: Per instructions this size will be good for about 15 seconds of use. I've had this for months and the safety I feel with it in my home has already so, so much more than paid for itself. Make sure everyone knows exactly where it is. I recommend close to but not in the kitchen. That's where the first is the most likely to start and you don't need to be  running with your ass on fire to grab the extinguisher. I looked at a lot of these things and initially did not want to spend the extra $20, but I'm glad I did.This extinguisher is solid and dependable. Trust me folks... And I am not paid by anyone to write this. Kiddie saved our house. Lightning hit out house sept 15th. Came through the outlet by stove and Started kitchen on fire in a matter of minutes. Wall was buring, stove, cabinets. This extinguisher put out most of the fire prior to the fire dept arriving. We live in the rural Midwest. It truly saved our house and possessions. Insurance covering all damage, but could have been a lot worse. If you don't have a fire extinguisher, please get one and make sure everyone knows how to use it... Even the kids. Thanks I got this for a Cobra Kit Car.  The problem with the smaller units is that if you ever do need to use it there isn't enough in them to to do any good unless you are really skillful in the art of fire extinguishing.  This unit is large enough to actually get a fire out, plus keep it out in the event. Great Product and awesome value. Must have in every home or office. Recharges and has non rust cylinder. The best of all .... lasts charged. In my opinion when it comes to your family and your house, one can never be too prepared. I bought this one to have a back up in the house. The original one we have is the same exact one just from Home Depot. Both great quality but I cannot attest to how well they work since (knock on wood) we've never needed them. But they are fire extinguishers and I am sure it will do its job if the time came. Nice and compact, not hard to understand the operation of use, and give an awesome reassuring feeling of safety. I highly recommend these to anyone. Teach even the little ones how to use it just in case. Can't speak for how it works, but we have it in our office and it takes up little space.  Easy to follow instructions, we mounted it to the wall with no problem. Comes with a sticker so that you can easily see where it is located.     product arrived very quickly, was exactly as advertised.  I hope I never need to use it, but have a comfort level now that I did not have before. One old extinguisher out in the shed had lost pressure and needed to be replaced, while the one I keep in the house near the woodstove still looked fine but I deemed it to be too small after research.  I think this is a good size to have in the event you need some sustained fire-fighting capability.  I hope it never happens, but I feel better to be prepared.  The company appears to be very responsive.  I recently was contacted by them about a potential problem - underpressurization - for two smaller units I purchased for the cellar and mancave, and they sent replacements right out. This beat out all of the home improvement stores for price. And you gotta have at least one of these sitting around in the house. Great value! While I hope to never need to use it, item seems quality in construction.Came in filled and Guage indicates correctly.  Comes with a hanger mount and sticker pointing to it so you can see it from a distance.Everyone needs one of these in your home just in case. I rent a condo and they don't have a fire extinguisher, so I thought it would be good to have one handy.  I ended up moving from my last rental because of a fire, so I have a real dislike for them.  I suggest if you rent and don't have homeowners insurance you get it.  I didn't have it last time and for the little money it cost per year it is worth it to me. I have seen these for as little as $39 with free shipping.  I like that the Kidde pro extinguisher is aluminum, metal, corrosion resistant, class A,B,C, and rechargeable/refillable!  We mount them on the kitchen walls of our rentals for ease of access.  They have a gauge which idicates when they need recharged, also making it easy to see if you do get a dud. I learned after I bought them that Fire Departments supply and recommend rechargeable extinguishers over the disposable junk out there.  Our fire department Tests for free and has nominal recharge/refill fees. We have other Kidde fire extinguishers in the house, this is a quality product as expected from Kidde. Its a really nice fire extinguisher, wall mount holder is well made and it comes with a sticker so you can put it on the wall near it or round a corner to draw attention to where you mount it. Very well made product and I hope I never need to use it, but I'm certainly happy to have it. arrived on time - properly packaged - Fortunately, I haven't had any fires that I didn't start on purpose - so can't verify its abilities.  Appears to be much nicer than the little guys with the cheap plastic handles. Bought two of them and they arrived and were clearly labeled as manufactured in 2015 on the bottom. Turns out our old units were made in 1992 and 2000. Definitely time to replace! No issues with leaking or damage in shipping. Arrived in great condition. Installed nicely with the more secure mounting bracket with the metal strap. How exactly do I write a product review for a product I haven't tested out yet?  I have yet to extinguish fires with this, but this works wonders on soft zombie heads.  Or it would...I think.  The item was not damaged and read a full green.  Sooooo hopefully, this doesn't change for a few years until I need to replace it  Not really sure how to write a review on something I hope to never use.  I bought it solely on the reviews and brand name, although I really wish it was made in the USA.Again, I haven't had to use this but felt it was an important addition to my office. Packaging was sturdy. The pin is a little loose that locks the handle, but that's better than the alternative. The metal handle is a much safer choice than the plastic. Overall, hopefully I never have to use it, but if I do, I imagine it will work just fine! Works as advertised. Instructions are clear. Saved my life... and my apartment from burning down. Will buy again. The extinguisher is heavy duty. That's Good! I've not used & hope that opportunity doesn't happen, howeverI think it will take care of the issue. I will hopefully buy another soon.I trust it.5 Stars!! I ordered this for out apartment. I wanted one that worked with electrical fires since our place is all electric A very nice fire extinguisher, nothing fancy, just your classic red fire extinguisher that fits nicely in the corner.  I hope to never have to use it, but it shipped quickly, and was exactly the size I needed.  Better safe than sorry! I've been unable to test this extinguisher.  Luckily my house hasn't caught fire as of yet.  But the extinguisher seems sturdy and well built.  It looks good sitting in kitchen pantry.  I also keep one near my wood burning stove in the basement. I purchased a brand new wood burning stove and laid in plenty of wood for the winter and of course needed to purchase some "just in case" extra fire extinguishers as the smaller ones I had werent sufficient if something really bad were to occur with the wood burning stove. The cost and quality of the extinguishers I received were superb and priced lower than I could find them anywhere locally, even if I would have paid tax I couldnt have found them for less (God help save us from any Internet tax).'I highly recommend these professional grade fire extinguishers that look and appear in every way EXACTLY like the ones you see in High Schools where many lives depend on having quality fire extinguishers. They are top notch products and I HIGHLY recommend them for any and everyone looking for a multi purpose (type of fire), fire extinguisher. GREAT BARGAIN BUY ON A SUPERIOR PRODUCT!! Thankfully, we have never had to use a fire extinguisher, but we bought this one as a replacement for one that was about 10 years old.  My research indicated this was a good brand and model, but how do you know until you have a fire?  Kidde has been around a long, long time, so I suspect their products are great.  I hope I never have a reason to find out just how great this fire extinguisher is. Great price and arrived promptly. Fire extinguisher comes with basic top mounting bracket and a standard Fire Extinguisher sign to mount above it.I purchased a wall mounting bracket and clamp. Would buy again!   Very nice fire extinguisher. I like that it came with a mount should I want to mount it. I just keep it on my kitchen counter. I hope I never have to use it. Because it's a Kidde, I know it will be there when I need it. Plus, it has a visual gauge for me to inspect and know when to have serviced. We already have one of these in our kitchen and one upstairs, but this one goes into our Earthquake supplies so we don't have to depend on our Fire Dept. to put out a fire that is more than likely going to happen after any major Earthquake. I'm not sure how anyone could review this without actually using it. Kidde is a well-known brand and is considered very reliable. I had a few old extinguishers in the house that looked older than me. They were remnants of the old homeowner. So we replaced them. I got two of this model, then another Kidde extinguisher in white instead of red which is designed for kitchen fires.Please make sure you protect your family: get at least one extinguisher for each level of your home. Get an extra extinguisher for the kitchen that is specifically designed for grease and oil fires. Check them every 3 months. I don't know what the recommended period is (6 month or 12 or whatever) but if you check them every quarter you should be fine. Happily, I am not rating this fire extinguisher's ability to put out a fire, as there has been no fires to put out. Thankfully. But, it does a great job at being a shiny red fire extinguisher sitting in the corner at the office. Everyone needs a fire extinguisher in their home.  This model is a good size and is applicable to most fires.  Consider one for your kitchen and laundry room.  Always try to store near an exit.  If you have kids consider training them on using it.  Ask your local fire department if they have training sessions. It arrived on time and was fully charged. My old, 20+ years, fire extinguisher had loss its pressure. The gauge moved from green to red. Therefore, I decided to replace all of them in my house. It comes with a mounting bracket but now molly bolts. A simple trip to the hardware store solved that. I pray I will never have to figure out how good it is. An excellent extinguisher, which I have yet to use, and hope it's never needed.  Wanted something larger than the usual smaller sizes to carry in the tow vehicle for my car trailer.  Along with this I ordered the Kidde 420119 PRO 340 Metal Bracket for 5 pound extinguishers.  Although I haven't physically mounted it, it fits superbly when tucked under the rearof the passenger seat. Hope I Never Have to use it. But if  I do, I know the Kidde will perform. Bought one 2 yrs ago just like this from the Big Blue-Box store.  Amazon Rocks! Now, I have TWO, waiting for the fire I pray never comes.Great price, fast shipping. FINEST PRODUCTThanks Kidde, and Amazon! I have never had to use this in an emergency, but I like knowing it's close by. The mount is adequate, and looks like it would be simple to activate in a frantic situation. Mine also came with a nice placard to place nearby. Good sized heavy duty extinguisher that I bought for home use. Hopefully we'll never have to use it, but if so the 4 lbs of powder it contains should do the job if a small fire breaks out. It comes with a heavy duty hanging bracket that if you want to use, it has 3 good sized holes for fastening to a wall (on a stud only), using scres/lag bolts you have to supply. However, some of the other reviews are correct that the ringed pin is very loose in the hole, and I could see how it could fall out accidently. My remedy was to wrap a very small piece of duct tape to the end of the pin so it can't fall out, but if you have to pull the pin out to use on a fire the tape will pull right off. Nice extinguisher, and I believe I'll buy another to keep one handy upstairs. Cheap insurance that can save life or property. 

     As a volunteer firefighter, I have used several extinguishers in the past of different brands, types and sizes. We purchased a box of these at a local hardware store to give away as part of a grant we got. After testing one of the units due to curiosity, It performed flawlessly. You need to check the pressure every once in awhile, to ensure it will work. This unit is good for 12 years and at minimum, Shake it up every 6 months to prevent the powder from compacting.Tested and approved by our fire dept! It is tough to write a review about something you have never used and hope you never do use but I'll give it a try.  I figured that the two fire extinguishers we have are at least 15 years old, possibly older.  I bought one of these so see if it is good quality before replacing both.  When this arrived I took down the one in our garage and discovered it is identical to the old one.  Here's the reason for the 5 star rating.  There is a gauge that show the state of charge and obviously the new one is right up in the green zone.  Well, guess what?  The old one is still showing a full charge.  I think I am now going to have 3 fire extinguishers instead of 2. This is one of those difficult items to rate.  I hope to never have to use any of them, and as such, I cannot comment on their usefulness.I will say, however, that they appear to be in working order, and for the most part the needles appear to be within the fully-charged zone on the dials.Again, they do seem to be high quality with regard to their appearance, and I hope to never have to report back on them after needing to use them. This thing worked like a charm, even better than I expected. It put out the fire instantly, and saved my entire kitchen - and possibly the entire house - from going up in flames.Even though the label on the extinguisher says to spray continuously for 6-8 seconds, after less than 1/2 second the fire was completely out, and everything was covered with a fine layer of white dust.If I had one complaint it would be that cleaning up after using this is a MAJOR pain.However, a few hours and a lot of elbow grease later, we still have a roof over our heads, and a new extinguisher on order. I've not tested this.. so it's hard to give a 5 star rating. But the extinguisher seems very well made. Solid build. And I trust it.I will update this if my house burns down and it's to blame.Also, it comes with a simple wall mount. No hardware. Not upset by that.I actually plan to keep this in my car for the next x years. As I drive for a living and have numerous electronic mods to my car, this seems like the wise choice.If nothing else, This could be a great blunt object in a road rage altercation. OR a smoke screen!I'll update this when it expires, and make a video of the discharge. This arrived exactly as advertised. I feel safer knowing I have this if I need it. I bought four, two in the house and one in each car. The price was very reasonable. If it is the difference between getting one of the kids out in a fire, it is worth every penny and more. Setting a calendar reminder to check themeach month, and bring them to the fire department for a check once a year. I purchased this product for my home.  I needed something small enough to mount to the inside wall of my pantry.  This item does that.  It came properly pressurized and with a wall bracket.The only problem I saw was the bracket.  It did not come with any screws or hardware.  Plus, the bracket is made of plastic and a little flimsy.Other than that, it was delivered quickly and the product was undamaged...thank you. Just bought my third one! These are great for the house, car, garage, upstairs, basement... You get the picture. You can't play with fire safety and you need to have at least one of these close to where you might be if a fire breaks out in your home. I keep one on each floor of my home and you should too. Ive just seen a video of a guy that saw an accident on the highway while driving and put out a car fire saving a woman's life. Now I need one for my car. Better safe than sorry. A fire extinguisher, carbon monoxide and smoke detectors are a must in every household. I've used these a few times, from a VW engine fire, to burning curtainry to the next door neighbor who had a grease fire. All three three times it was the same Kidde as the one I have purchased today. Always stànd back and aim for the base of the flames. Sweep back and forth. That's the first thing you're taught in basic marine firefighting ( thanks India Tango Ballard ).Make sure after a few months you invert the unit and tap on the base to keep the chemicals mixed. Be safe everyone. We needed to purchase a small fire extingusher because my husband is on oxygen. They say they want one un our house at all times. I believe this to be a very nice brand. We have never used it and hope we never need it. So, I cannot tell about how it works. I can only say it looks to be of the same quality materials that others are made of.           Very good product.  Well built and would be easy to use.  All is secure so little chance of accidentally opening.  This bottle has material for all fires including electronic and can be used for fuel fires.These comment are for ALL extinguishers.  As with any extinguisher with meter, one needs to check often for they do leak.  Mine has no sign of leaking, but over long time will, all do.  This why in businesses may gov require a certified inspection yearly.  Also the meters will stick, they stick in all units.  So when checking hard tap the meter to make sure it is free.  It could stick in full position, but bottle could be empty.  When tapping see that meter needle moves, that is vibrates to show it is free. Bought this fire extinguisher almost two years ago. It sat in our cabinet until yesterday when we had a fire in the kitchen. This extinguisher put it out and surely prevented lots of additional damage. Couldn't ask for more. Literally the best money I have ever spent.I will say that I drained the whole bottle putting out the (relatively small) fire, so I might go for a larger capacity extinguisher or have more than one available next time. Bought this for the house for emergencies. I had read a lot about them arriving at the buyer's home already discharged in the box. Most of those stories on this review thread seemed to be in situations where the buyer bought multiple extinguishers, so i decided to just buy one to start with. It arrived in good condition and tested just fine when I sprayed it. I haven't had a chance to use it on an actual fire and I hope I never have to. It's hard to write a reveiw for a product that you purchase, hoping that you never need to use it after you buy it.  So I can only say that it seems to be well built and study, conveniently sized, and directions printed on the label. I won't know how well it works unless I actually have an emergency, and I don't want that to happen.  Description was accurate and the product was as advertised.  Price was write and shipping was convenient. I would do business with this vendor again. 👍I wanted a cheap ABC extinguisher. This one fit the bill exactly👍Boxed and shipped securely. No leaks or damage to unit👍Easy to remove pin in an emergency, but difficult enough that it doesn't "fall out"👍I bought 2. Both registered green on the meter👌Haven't used it for a fire (and hopefully never will need to), so can't attest to usage. ....but, the car that got totaled leading to purchase of a new Wrangler emptied the gas tank when it was rather violently sideswiped. The gas did not ignite but, having recently reached one big milestone birthday, I plan to be here for more, thus.....ya know, semper paratus (Always Ready). Have this in a bungied milk carton in the back of the jeep until the rugged ridge crash bar holder arrives.I also have a few similar throughout the house. CYA as they say!! I have been in possession of this most excellent fire extinguisher for a few weeks and there has not been a single instance of fire in my abode. I cannot say enough about this product and insist that all of you purchase one in the event that your kitchen spontaneously combusts.Seriously. Own a fire extinguisher. Everyone needs one, we purchased it a few months ago, and wouldn't you know it, we had an outside Christmas decoration catch fire this year and we needed it.  You never know when you'll need it, so purchase yours before the fire you didn't think would happen. I guess I love this because it's compact and fits under the bar, and treats all types of fire.  I'd like to test it on the toaster buy my husband says "no."  So does it actually work?  We'll find out if and when there's a fire.  Will keep you posted. Nice compact design for the kitchen.  We just had a baby so I decided to replace the one I used up years ago when I had a small under-hood fire on my car.  I will be buying one of these for my next hot rod project as well.  Great product for a great price.            Great for under my kitchen sink. Under the sink in the kitchen. I hope I never see it perform Perfect for a 2br apartment. Hope I never have to use it! hope i never get to use it! Quality unit.  Very pleased Everything was as expected. Gratefully we haven't had to use this, so this review is based only on the product at arrival. It seems sturdy and easy to use and it feels good knowing I have access to an extinguisher if I need it. We bought these Fire Extinguishers for our granddaughters who sleep in upstairs bedrooms of old two storie houses. We will sleep better knowing their have these if thereever is a fire in their house.         handy to have around Good looking extinguisher. Mounted nicely. I feel safe now! I would buy again but hopefully never have to. I mounted on in my kitchen and one in my garage. EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCT AND GOOD PRICE. THE PRODUCT IS PERFECT SIZE FOR THE HOME/KITCHEN OR ANY AREAS.THIS IS A GREAT ITEM TO PURCHASE FOR THE HOUSEHOLD. I keep this between my Kitchen and Backyard. I hope it works. I paid $20 for this and I have seen the same model at Lowes & Home Depot for the same price. Great all purpose extinguisher, fits perfect in the Rugged Ridge 13305.21 holder.  Looks great in the back of the jeep and hopefully that is will it stay. It's a cute little red fire extinguisher... What more needs to be said! Fortunately, I haven't had to use it yet. I'll update the review if that changes. Bought two as christmas gifts for my son's new houses... yeah, they thought I was crazy, but makes me feel better.  I would definitely purchase it again! Since you only know if a fire extinguisher works when there's a fire.  But a model made by the same company lasted 20 years when we tested it this year. Can't speak for the efficacy of this fire extinguisher, as I have not caught anything on fire recently. Looks solid, hopefully I never have to use it. Good, efficient size fire extinguisher.  I bought these for our cars.  You should have a fire extinguisher in your car.  It could save someone's life.   I haven't had to use it yet, thank goodness. But it seems like it will work great. Light weight and fits under the sink nicely. ABC extinguisher. lightweight and easy to install. Hopefully won't have to use it! Seems like a perfect option for keeping around the house as a safety precaution Great compact fire extinguisher. simple and obvious to use (as bad as it may sound some people have NO CLUE how to use one). Easy to wall-mount. It came new,clean,and with alot of instructions as well.I have not used it yet BUT WHEN I DO..........ILL WRITE AN UPDATE HERE WITH THE RESULTS. I like the medium size. I can take it anywhere. It can fit in my kitchen pantry or be mounted on the wall. It's exactly what I was looking for. Not much to say.  I got it in good condition.  It was charged.  Looks easy to operate.  I hope it sits in the back area for many years to come. Bought this for my work truck. Nice. Compact.Not much to say. It's sitting in my toolbox.Hope to never have to use it. Every Christmas, I like to get my family things like fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and the like, for their safety and my peace of mind. Arrived in excellent condition. Thank goodness haven't had to use it, but am sure it will work fine if the need ever arises. Would recommend. Great for any home -- the wall-mount was a bonus as well. I taught my kids how to use these and they are the perfect size for anyone age 5+.    I like the size of the extinguisher, good for stashing in cabinets or car trunk, wherever needed. Quality construction, good purchase. Fortunately I haven't used it but i mounted it in my fishing boat. The bracket holds it firmly in place while running in rough water. Have not had to use it, hopefully never have to. But the construction feels sturdy and am confident that this will perform if needed. Promptly delivered and exactly what I needed for my apartment. Hopefully I will never have to use it but it adds a sense of security. .... but I'm not sure cause I haven't had to put out a fire yet!  The delivery was on time and the product looks good, as advertised. I recommend that everyone have an extinguisher in their home.  I have never had to use one but just knowing it's there is comforting. I haven't had to use it thankfully and hopefully never have to but it looks good, mounts easily and seems to be of good workmanship. I haven't had to use it thankfully, but based on reviews from people who work in the fire fighting field I knew I couldn't go wrong! I bought this to go under my sick in my kitchen. It hasn't needed to be used yet, but is a great size and looks like superb quality This is our second Kidde FA110 extinguisher. The first one did an excellent job of extinguishing a small fire in my son's RC truck.  This is a great fire extinguisher to have around the house.I even got to verify it works when my girlfriend started a little grease fire!When my brother bought his first house, this was in the new homeowner gift bag I got him. I don't know why I didn't have this in my kitchen already. Every home should have one if not more of these basic safety tools in their homes. My family put this in the house this year when my brain tumor came back this year. It is great and easy to use. We recently had a dryer fire due to lint build up. It was very scary and we almost burned the house down running to get a large bucket of water. After that decided it was time to get this extinguisher and keep it by the dryer just in case. Highly suggest it but have thankfully not had to actually use it and hopefully never will! The children are intrigued though so we need to store it in a hard to reach place! House hasn't burned down once since installing this extinguisher, no fires to put out but HEY, gotta start somewhere.  Important, and serious, point though...Kiddie had some sort of RECALL on this model so make sure when you get it to check their website and see if your serial number is affected.  We received a free replacement recently.  Also, the plastic bracket that comes with this unit is decent for wall mounting but the metal (optional) bracket is much much nicer and easier to remove the extinguisher when in a hurry.  Amazon has the metal bracket for $5 or $10 dollars I think. You can never be too safe, right? I've been a homeowner for about 10 years now, and somehow for most of that time, I managed not to know that you have to recharge or replace your fire extinguishers - if you have rechargeables, they have to be maintained every 6 years; if they're replaceable, every 12-13 years. Well, heck.I actually live in the house where I grew up, having remodeled and moved in after my mom passed away in 2004. When I moved in, I had literally no homeownership knowledge whatsoever. I've learned as I go, often the hard way. Thank goodness I didn't learn the hard way here!As soon as I learned about replacing fire extinguishers, I started doing my research to find the right units for our home. I bought these extinguishers (I ordered 3 of them) because they were reasonably-priced and had exceptional reviews.I now have one on every floor. These fire extinguishers are smaller than I expected, and as such, they take up less space than I anticipated. So I like that aspect quite a lot. While I have not had occasion to use them (thank goodness!), I do sleep a lot better at night knowing that if anything were to happen, I'd be ready.I am somewhat concerned by the reviewer who said that it didn't work for her. I don't know how one could know in advance whether it's going to work or not. From everything I have read, the only testing that one can do of a fire extinguisher is visual, so I take some comfort in the other reviewers who have said that this product saved their home or their neighbor's home. I bought two of these Fire Extinguishers for my home, which doubles as a daycare, one for each floor. I hope that I never have to use them, but I feel safer knowing that I have them around! Just watch for recalls because one of the ones that I bought had been recalled, but a quick form filled out to the manufacturer and they shipped a new one free of charge. Have to have one.  It can save lives.So I have tested this and it put out an outdoor bonfire.This is all you need.  I keep them properly hidden in my home to be able to get to them or a window.  Which ever you need 1st. I moved to a new apartment in the city and I was not aware about the existing policy by the management of bringing our own fire extinguisher in case of fire related accident. I dont know where to buy such but thank goodness I was able to encounter it here in Amazon! The fire extinguisher looks so elegant and does not make my room dull. COMES WITH A BRACKET. I don't know why the seller doesn't make it very apparent that it comes with a wall-mounting bracket. It had a hard plastic collar which carries most of the weight, as well as a flexible band about halfway down the cylinder to hold it against the wall. The 'button' that closes the band is hard to close, but very easy to pull open so you won't waste any time when the extinguisher is needed. The bracket is designed so that the status of the extinguisher -- in the green, meaning ready to use, or not -- is clearly displayed, just like in the picture.This is the second one I've had. I left the first one in my previous house. Even after 10 years of hanging on the wall, it was still in the green.By the way, my home owner's insurance claims that having a fire extinguisher (as well as ceiling sprinklers) qualifies me for a lower rate. Back when I owned a farm I kept five of these on hand.  But you need to keep them away from teenagers who can be both curious and adventurous. And boys can become fascinated by the sound and mess they spread around.  Knowing the dangers of fire one young fellow tested one "just to make sure it worked", and he found out that it did. Not wanting to take any chances, he decided to test them all.  After he was finished with his testing he reported that every one of them worked perfectly.  I suppose he considered it to be practice in case of a fire, but they were all now very empty.    Had a fire the other day and wife tried using this as I wasn't home. It blew a small puff out and that was it. Ended up calling the fire dept. Come to find out today that she didn't know how to use it. The handle is made of plastic so the end bent down and didn't push the lever. If you press down a little further up on the lever it works great. This really goes for all safety devices, make sure you know exactly how to use them- before you have to use them. The fireman said metal handles are the best as they don't bend. I did some research about fire extinguishers and found several references to Kidde as the best available. So I bought two. Delivery was very prompt from Lighting Sales. I was afraid they might be old, but the manufacture date, printed on the canister, is 2015, so they're fresh stock. I hope I won't ever find out how well they work, but they appear to be very well made. They come with a simple but effective hook, so they can be hung on a wall (anchored to a stud, of course). Have a few on hand and came back to buy another. I like the convenience and practicality of this one. It fights all kind of fires one might encounter. It comes with a bracket that can be attached to a wall, ceiling or wherever you wish to attach it. The extinguisher attaches to the holder and removes easily when one needs to use it.Overall, a great multi-purpose fire extinguisher to keep on hand at home, office, or boat. These are perfect size for the home owner to handle. However, they really won't handle a very large fire. Make sure that you ordered extra.Shipping was free with 5 plus days. I got them in two. So good.Also was concerned that these might be old. Ordered them in December 2015, they were made in November same year.Figuring out the manufacture date took some doing. Find a 10 character code on the side of the can. Digits five through nine represent the day and year of manufacture in DDDYY format. So for example, January 1st, 2015 would be XXXX 00115 X. Check now before you need it. Also check the dial to make sure it is in the green. This is a nice, affordable fire extinguisher, that is fairly easy to install. I haven't had to use it (and hopefully never will), so I can't attest to its effectiveness at extinguishing a fire. But, I feel good to know I now have one of these babies strapped to my wall in case the need arises.The only struggle I had was attempting to strap the extinguisher into the wall mount. I was unable to strap the extinguisher in place after it had been mounted, so I resorted to fastening the strap first, and then slowly sliding the extinguisher in place. It now is mounted firmly (I gave it a good tug to test it) on the wall. Do not believe scare tactics. For household non commercial use it is excellent. I have had 2 of these for years and used one once.  The older ones I have are not flimsy, just do not put it in your trunk and let it roll around. It is durable, many excellent products are made with plastic. I am buying a spare, if any different, will comment. I ordered several of these for my different trucks and cars. I wasn't sure how they would fit in different spots I wanted to put them, but they seem to fit good, and will be nice for when I really need them. I like to be prepared for anything and with this I will be able to. I have not actually had to use it, but when I do I will update my review to tell everyone know how they work. I can't really rate this product on use yet as, thankfully, I have not yet had to use it.  What I can rate it on is peace of mind.  Being a brand new homeowner and thinking of all of the things that could potentially go wrong, especially living with some family right now who aren't very smart this product gives me peace of mind.  I will eventually purchase 2 more of these, one for the garage and one for the basement but right now just having one conveniently mounted on a cabinet in my kitchen is very reassuring. Yep...another review on how this handy little extinguisher saved my studio! I use a small oven in my art studio...and I set the blasted thing on fire! But I grabbed this powerful little Kidde and it's aim was so good I put the fire out quickly...with almost no discharge powder anywhere else. A couple of blasts of this at the base of the fire and poof, it was out! Clean up was SO EASY. Everything was saved, even the oven! I'm buying another today. I refuse to be without a Kidde by my side! This is the perfect size extinguisher for my office here in our apartment. We haven't used it yet so we don't know how to rate the device technically but we will give it five stars bc it looks great. If it doesn't work in the future we will come back to change our review.       These should be in every car. There is no reason not to have one on you even just driving in a city and daily commuting. It could mean the difference in saving a car, or a life. I have 2 in my Jeep, especially when off roading. Hopefully I'll never know how good this fire extinguisher is.  I think everyone should own one though.  I have heard plastic parts are to be avoided, but this seems like a quality fire extinguisher to me.  Comes with instructions and a wall mount. I haven't had to use this and really hope I never do but it is great to have at least one on hand in your house. It is very compact and can fit easily under the sink without taking up a lot of space. I got it for about $20 and feel like that is a price you can't beat. Single use extinguisher.  Good to have in the home or car.  We have one in our home, mounted on the wall for ease of use in kitchen or laundry should the need occur; and we have one in each of our vehicles.  Reasonably priced, good safety product.  Highly recommend. I almost lost my house to a candle fire many years ago.  If you don't have fire extinguishers in your house, you really should!  Like the credit card commercial says.. "saving your home from burning to the ground.... priceless!" Haven't had to use it yet, but nice & small & it provides peace of mind.  Tucks nicely inside a closet, the instructions for use are very clear.  Hopefully I"ll never need it, but glad to have it. We have Kidde Fire Extinguishers throughout the house.... We trust the brand..."Kidde"..  If I need to use a fire extinguisher, I want it to work...so, I don't just go with the CHEAP price...I go with the brand I trust... No issues, with it, Its a pretty standard fire extinguisher. Just needed one to keep in the kitchen for easy access. Pretty great that I can attach it securely to a wall and still have relatively easy access in a emergency. I replaced my 15 year old Kidde which had lost it's pressure. I'm glad I never had to use it. The only problem with this model is the plastic mounting strap is very hard to buckle, Need to use a small screwdriver to snap it together. This is the one you want to buy- for you in the truck, tool box, and the garage. For her, in the kitchen for those stove fires, and for both of you in or near the bath or bedroom. It is NOT for putting out a roaring fire in your house; just getting the fire settled down where you can get out the door! That is what 20 pounders are for.The price is so reasonable you have no excuse for putting it off-- buy two today! You will never need it unless you have a fire, and it will probably be in the way all the time, but if you have a fire?????Seriously, it is so easy to operate, you can train her and the kids in a few minutes. It has a gauge which shows that it is charged- just point and squeeze- no hose to fool with!   I bought one to mount near the kitchenette (toaster oven) and one near the bedroom (space heater). This worked for me to have one, as suggested, within forty feet of potential sources, as well as exits. I like having the gauge to show it is fully charged. This saved my life and my apartment complex.The fire started in the oven and flames shot up the back near the cupboards.  I was able to put out the fire with this extinguisher before it spread.  The yellow powder is difficult to clean up afterwards. This was competitively priced, exactly as expected.  I didn't see mounting screws with it, but never mounted my last one.  I've never checked to see if these are refillable, but the price is so reasonable, that it may not be worth the trouble. Fortunately I haven't had to use it yet, so I can't attest to the product's actual ability to put out a fire. But I received it in excellent condition, fully charged. The extinguisher seems sturdy, as does the bracket to hang it. Must have for all adults/trained youngsters. Immediate results saving people/property. Read read review review before u need it in emergency. Leaves non-toxic dust to vacuum after emergency over. PREVENTS  bigger emergency. Came fully charged, with a mounting bracket, but now screws. I think for the price they should have tossed in the screws.12/13/14 Received a recall notice from Kidde that the fire extinguisher is defective. I'm proud of them for admiring their error and fixing it. They said it would take between 4 and 6 weeks to get a replacement. ABC is useful for multiple types of fires, great for a kitchen as you can use it on grease flame ups.Pro's: comes with a nice wall mount that can screw into a wall stud if you want to free up some shelving/counter space. I LOVE that, because I'm in a small apartment.Con's: no excuse to play with this toy until I start a fire, and that's too bad because I'll bet it's pretty satisfying to fire off. Lol, what do you say about a fire extinguisher unless you have used it. I bought 4 of these; one for each of the kids; and one for Mom; as a 'funny' Christmas present. Or....a 'needed' item?! They all sort of laughed when I gave them out, like: Huh?! Well, I feel that every home needs one and they all understood the idea. These came nice and neatly packaged! They will work on any type of fire; so I am personally pleased that they all have one!  To me; you never know when you might need the thing! So a great idea! For those living in the middle 20th century, Modern plastics far surpass other materials in the 21st century. The tank is aluminum for one thing, which does not corrode like steel. The handle and valve are made of nylon a very strong and appropriate material which also does not corrode. As far as it being not refillable, I think if it saves your house from not burning down for around $25, it is a great bargain. If it saves everything I own one time I would gladly buy another one. It is best to have at least 2 of these placed where you can get to them at all times. I also have a white one in the kitchen. These are a invaluable bargain. This fire extinguisher arrived overnight!  Very pleasantly surprised because I was advised it would be a few extra days in shipping.I don't know how to review something that I haven't used - and hope to never need to use.I will say that this extinguisher appears to be very good quality.  The canister is sturdy, strong and well documents the procedure incase I need to use it.  I keep it under my kitchen sink for easy access.This extinguisher is very affordable and something my family feels is extremely important to keep in our home.        Just what I needed to replace one that had become out of date in our RV. Have never needed to use the old one, but wanted to be sure that the new one would be ready if needed. Rather be safe than sorry. My neighbor is a firefighter and he says that Kidde Corporation makes the best fire extinguishers. He uses them for training and says they are very dependable. They are recharged very easily.I would recommend it to my friends, or anyone needing a dependable extinguisher for their home. We bought 2 of these - one for the garage and one for the kitchen.  They are not too large, have good instructions - and we hope we never have to use them.  Emergencies happen fast, though, and you have to be prepared. Great product in a compact size. Have one in each vehicle, garage, boat, rv and under the kitchen sink! You never know when you'll need one and it is easy to use! Got mine at the local Home Depot for $19.  Opened and checked it in the store to ensure it was fully charged and there were no leaks.  Looks sturdy and well built.  I can't comment on whether it works and how good it works until I actually use it...and this is one product I hope I will never have to use. It's a fire extinguisher and fortunately I haven't needed to use it.  Delivery was quick and I ordered the Rugged Ridge Holder 13305.21 to go with it.  They both went together perfectly.  The only issue was finding a spot on the roll cage of my JK to mount them. This is my second purchase the first one we had a small kitchen fire and it worked as it should to put the fire out. I would buy another without hesitation. Looks very good. The fire extinguisher is a bit smaller than I expected but should work as advertised. For a larger area I would suggest a larger model. After having only the bigger extinguishers I changed over to something I could handle myself and this is the perfect size..very happy with it too!! Exact replacement for the one I discharged putting a grease fire on my stove. I'm a firm believer in having a fire extinguisher in your kitchen.    Hopefully it works good.. Hopefully I never have to use.. Good peace of mind to have though! is now in kitchen, good to know we have a way to keep our house a little safer Haven't had to use it yet but it looks great. Makes me feel safe. Fortunately haven't had to use it yet, but it is of good quality Arrived on time and is the perfect size fore my home office. Bought this to replace one in kitchen.  Just what we needed. Well built- great packaging- excellent service from Amazon Great item, I will be giving these out as Christmas gifts! Inexpensive compared to others we priced and work well! Great item just as described!  Hangs in the kitchen!
