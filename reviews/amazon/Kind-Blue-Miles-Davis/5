 The first time I owned this disc (in college), I purchased it after a conversation with a friend whose taste in music I trusted. I did not own any jazz at the time and KOB was my first foray into the genre. I did not get it. I did not like it especially. As a person coming from a hard rock background, I felt like the music was too disorganized (!)...so I sold it.A few years later I purchased it again when Columbia began to remaster Davis' recordings. By this time I was really getting into jazz and already had a good number of albums. As I listened to this disc again, with fresh ears, I was floored. I heard what Wynton Marsalis described in the Ken Burns film 'Jazz' as Miles 'sustained intensity'. See, this is NOT music that hits you over the head and says HELLO! This is music that quietly beckons you in a subtle way. This disc is flawless *but* I do not necessarily recommend it as a first buy for jazz greenhorns. For me, I needed to hear numerous Coltrane albums (My Favorite Things, Giant Steps, Blue Train) along with Dave Brubeck's "Take Five" and Quincy Jones' jazz/funk masterpiece "Walkin In Space" before I was ready to return to "Kind of Blue".Some have complained about the lack of intensity on the disc, Miles playing, and it's sleep-inducing qualities...well look at the title of the disc! KIND OF BLUE! This is not meant to be a fierce tenor battle like "Tenor Madness", "Chasing the Trane", "Orbits", or "Giant Steps". This IS late night music for many people, relaxing music. It's anytime music for me. It is what it is and some people have a hard time accepting it for that. Great music doesn't always grab you by the throat. Sometimes it burrows into your brain and plants a seed because you aren't ready to appreciate it yet. People have their own opinions about what jazz is or is not, but to claim that Louis Armstrong and Duke comprise 'real' jazz, but Miles is somehow outside of that tradition is ridiculous. It all depends on where you are coming from. Hard-rockers will probably appreciate later, crazier "Ascension" period Coltrane before they appreciate more subtle works like Kind of Blue. I needed to hear other things first-I wanted the fire and passion of jazz like Coltrane's "Countdown" and "I want to talk about you" before I could place tunes from this disc in some sort of context.So if you don't *get* this album, wait for a while and pursue some other jazz recordings. If you don't have previous jazz-listening experience, KOB may sound like just another album to you. But for an experienced jazz fan, (when listened to in the context of so many other recordings) this one stands above most everything else.Essential. This is arguably the best jazz recording of all time.  It is definitely the most influential.  This recording h as it all.  great modal jazz featuring great saxophone solos by John Coltrane and Julian  "Cannonball" Adderly. Bill Evans , Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb  comprise the rest of this great sextet.  Miles  always  selected great  musicians to play with but this group was the best. This album gave us two  future standards "So What" and "All Blues" and three  other gems ("Freddie Freeloader," "Blue in Green" and  "Flamenco Sketches. This album is an essential purchase for all music  lovers - even those who do not like jazz( it will change your mind)The  only valid reason I can think of to not buy this is that you  have the  money to buy the newly released Miles Davis/ John Coltrane Complete  Columbia Recordings 6 CD Box Set  which includes this album in its  entirety. do not waste your time reading this - get it & listen to the  music. I don't listen to much jazz, except on the radio. Anyone out there who forces themselves to listen to pop/rock radio stations should give the jazz stations a try some time. Less commercials, you won't hear the same songs every half hour, it's just such a more pleasurable experience. Anyways, this album is one of the first pieces of music I ever heard (my father is a huge jazz aficionado) and it has remained one of my personal favorite albums for many years. It's incredible, the emotions that this album can bring out in you. Starting out with So What, one of the best hum-along songs ever, it moves through track after track of perfect music, and incredible solos. I consider the high point of the album to be the opening of All Blues, which has got to be the most catchy song ever written. As the album closes with Flamenco Sketches, the tempo slows to a near crawl, and I always feel completely mellow by the end of that song. People will say it's the best album to relax to, the best album to have sex to, and so on, but really it is just one of the best albums to listen to, period. I couldn't have picked a better cd to be introduced to at such a young age, and I hope all of you expose this album to your children so they can hear what music is supposed to sound like. This was my very first jazz album, and it is still my favorite.  After listening to many other recordings by many other artists (including a small amount of today's "smooth" jazz, which is really elevator music  with another name), I still come back to Kind of Blue.  This work, like all  truly magnificent works in every genre of art,  works on many levels.  It  is wonderful background music, and it is infinitely more amazing when one  truly LISTENS to what the musicians are doing on the tracks.If you  love jazz but for whatever reason have missed this album, BUY IT - you will  not be disappointed.  If you have never listened to jazz before (smooth  jazz doesn't count), this cd is a perfect entry into the realm of jazz.  Its recording artists all became famous on their own afterwards, and in  Kind of Blue, the mastery of each is obvious.  Its music achieves  perfection and timelessness, and is a monument of jazz - a great buy! Well, it is a must and not just for a jazz listener but for every human being appreciates pure, simple and wonderful music. Miles had a unique skill to transform his art into something everyone could identify with. Miles tried to transcend the simple blues pattern. He succeeded. Yet, he remains on Earth, immanent in every note, his entire being fixed on one cause. I am not sure what made this album the jazz album of all time, as many like to say, but it is one of a kind. Although Miles had always possessed this lyrical palate in his horn, the combination of those players makes it a highlight that not often a musician experience. Certainly, it is a more rare moment in recording jazz album. All must be in perfect shape.Now listen to the quiet opening of So What. It catches you right from the start. The simple chorus line holds you attentive and you can feel the note progress like a heartbeat. Loud and clear blues walk with some wonderful moments of interaction between Coltrane and Miles. The rhythm section is strong and attentive, again, in an unusual way - listen to some of Evans chords."All Blues" and "Freddie Freeloader" are Tour de Force of each and every one of the players. One cannot describe the hours of pleasure this little album gave me along the years. To the serious jazz listener/musician a word of advice: It is recommended to have the Coltrane-Miles full set along side the original in order to study the development of this one of a kind group recording and perhaps understand Miles thinking process. I am a huge jazz fan, but i wasn't always. I never thought anything of the music, and was always more into pop and rock. This is the album that changed that. However, it didn't happen immediately. I put it on as background music and throughout the course of about...seven years, i noticed the album a little more, until suddenly, it dawned on me that this is the greatest american accomplishment, as far as art and beauty are concerned. Eventually, i began to explore more jazz, finding greatness like Kind of Blue but never equaling it. Thus, this is THE album to buy, whether you like jazz, like i do now, or don't care for it, like i didn't before i listened to it. It begins with a haunting prelude, which forces inattentive ears to pay attention, and then the album takes off. It echoes and creates a mood that will raise the hairs off your neck. All through the album, there is this chilling feeling, which i later realized to be the most beautiful music ever created. Everyone knows Miles Davis is a Genius(read his book, "Miles" with Quincy Troupe to learn more), but this is the album that makes that statement such a truism. The arrangements, the magic surrounding its one-take-only tracks, and the individual strength of each player is overwhelming at times. Paul Chambers, bassist, secures a grooving and dark beat, accompanied by drummer Jimmy Cobb, who lays back but maintains a presence. Pianist Bill Evans achieves sheer beauty out of simplicity in both soloing and comping(playing behind solos). Wynton Kelly, pianist on #2 Freddie Freeloader, ignites the only really speedy tune and lays down a bouncing blues solo. John Coltrane, tenor master and additional music genius, achieves splendid lyricism and, when analyzed, one finds great complexity in his seemingly simple, yet powerful solos. Julian "Cannonball" Adderley is equally lyrical, original, and adds much needed warmth to a chillingly beautiful album. What can be said about Davis? It is an understatement to remark on his shocking simplicity, his genius for soloing and composing, and his unique tone, which has yet to be matched by any contemporary or past trumpeter. The album closes on the modal Flamenco Sketches, a series of five scales which give both the feelings of Spanish culture (see Miles' "Sketches of Spain" for further elaboration on this)and also a feeling of pure heaven. The album should be called "Kind of Heaven", because, after one listens to it and finds its true beauty, that is where one will be. A stunning achievement and a hopeful introduction to the immense world of Jazz and American Art. This album is probably the most flawless Jazz masterpiece ever released. Miles must have been one hellova talent scout to get John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley together on this classic Album.What makes this album so great? Firstly the artists are some of the most influential artists in the Jazz World. Secondly, this is not just an ordinary jazz album. By using modes instead of chord structures to base improvisation, Miles gave his sidemen (and himself) the artistic freedom to express themeselves. You will hear on this album Miles's signature emotional playing, John Coltrane's reflective and haunting style and Adderley's cheery personality seeping into his music. The tracks chosen are perfect, with So What probably being the best cut, altough they are all lovely.This album is no where near as hard as some of Miles's later work, and so will appeal to more people. The best thing about this album is that every single not just belongs where it is, and it sounds as fresh as anything released today. The sound quality of the CD reissue is fantastic (except for the slight tape hiss) and it feels like the musicians are right in front of you. Even if you don't like jazz, get this; you may change your mind. This is truly the work of a musician's musician. Ever been in a position where you avoid something...simply because people are forcing it on you?  I have never watched an episode of "Friends" simply because people kept telling me I would love it.  And so it is with "Kind of Blue."Who knew?  I guess I did.No failing to live up to expectations here.More impulsive than "Porgy and Bess," and less structured than "Sketches of Spain," this album feels both relaxed and rich, complex but soothing.Working through the timelines, I would guess that with this album, Davis did as much to free jazz artists as the camera did to free portrait artists.Consider the tight structure of Brubeck or the levity of Charlie Parker...and then listen to this album again.  Davis may have done as much to being free jazz from structure as Jelly Roll Morton did 50 years prior.  (Sure, Jelly claims to have INVENTED Jazz, but that's another discussion.)Yeah, this album is as good as everyone has told you it is.  And, if you are, like me, dragging your feet about it, you're only wasting your time.  This really is one of the greatest jazz albums - ever.I am still avoiding "Friends." though. I bought this album because I have recently started listening to jazz and someone told me this is the jazz album to own and they were right. This album is simply great. Recorded on April 22, 1959 unrehearsed and in on take, this album combines the some of the greatest jazz musicians of all time in one fabulous CD. Miles is great of course, but he is joined by John Coltrane on sax, Bill Evans on piano, Cannonball on sax as well, Paul Chambers on bass, and Jimmy Cobb on drums.I love this CD because it is one of the few jazz CDs I have listened to where I feel every note is rightly chosen and that it all works well together. The improvisation is great and these are truly artists who work well with each other. I highly recommend getting one of the most recent re-releases of this CD as well, many of the original audio problems have been fixed and all of the musical instruments sound a thousand times better.This album is much more traditional jazz than some of Miles later stuff, which makes sense since in some ways it defines jazz. It is truly amazing that Miles was able to take jazz and play with it as he wanted, this CD sounds different in many ways than something like Birth of the Cool but they are both great. If you like this CD I would also recommend Coltrane's Love Supreme which is very similar in its flavor.Overall I highly recommend this CD to anyone who wants to know what the greatest jazz artists sounded like at a time when they were performing there absolutely best. This is the cornerstone of any jazz collection; this is the place to begin if you are a jazz neophyte. If you are unfamiliar with jazz this is probably what you imagine jazz sounds like. Miles Davis was important not  only for the great music he made but also for the incomparable sideman he  worked with-such as saxophonist John Coltrane, here. From the classic,  swinging opening bars of "So What" to Miles' signature muted trumpet in the  ballad, "Blue and Green" this CD best summarizes all that is great about  jazz. Over the last few years the Columbia/Legacy label has begun an  incomparable reissue program of Miles Davis' 50s and 60s albums. This, and  the other reissues, contain restored cover artwork, great re-mastered  sound, original liner notes and current reflections on Miles' work. The  sound re-mastering on this CD is first class. You will hardly believe that  this was recorded in 1959-the sound is so clear and warm. I cannot  recommend this CD enough!  I received this CD as a gift, and my first reaction was, "Oh. It's just jazz," and I promptly forgot about the CD, which displayed my own ignorance about Miles AND this album. Then, after sifting through my stack of discs for something new to play in my car one day, I found "Kind of Blue" and thought I'd give it a try.On first listen, it was nice. I hate to say that because some people think a listener should be bowled over by this album once the disc is in the player. That didn't happen to me. Instead, I discovered a melancholy mood in the album that I would come back to again, and again, and again, until I was literally being plunged into a trance every time I listened to the album. That is what I mean when I say, "I have arrived." I finally FEEL the album. It's now a part of me. Once the song "So What" comes on, I am in a rhythmic hallucination, awash in subtle trumpet tones, sax phrases, piano comp, drum fills, and I feel like I finally know what people mean when they call this album the most influential jazz album of all time.Now, when you listen to this CD, I don't expect you to feel the same way at the same time I did. You may arrive sooner than I did, or you may get there later. However, if you buy this album, and you appreciate jazz even in its most basic forms, you will arrive, my friend. You will arrive. Well, this is It. One of jazz's greatest. It's interesting though, this is the only album that is consistently in Amazon's top 100 chart that has been released more than a year ago. Not Darkside of the Moon or any of those other corny albums is there. Kind Of Blue is kind of humble but it  has that staying power. There isn't much I can say about KOB though, read  the other 120 reviews before me!This was a lot of people's first intro  to jazz. I'd say that if Kind of Blue is your first intro and you're  looking for something else, well there are some classics to check on that  don't get the press that this one does.Idle Moments by Grant Green is a  great starting point. Very mellow, dreamy but hard hitting jazz. Oliver  Nelson's The Blues and the Abstract Truth is a classic. An unknown great is  Roy Haynes's Out of a Friday Afternoon which contains all the sound and the  fury from drummer Haynes, and multireed legand, Rashaan Roland Kirk. Get  that one! Herbie Hancock's Takin' Off is a funky fun one. John Coltrane's  My Favorite Things is steamy and smooth and intense, while A Love Supreme  is his relentless search for spirituality.You might want to check out  Bill Evans's Sunday at the Village Vanguard or Waltz for Debby for some  beautiul, live, almost telapathic interplay between piano-bass-drums. Grant  Green's guitar-organ-drums trio, Talkin' About cooks, while Larry Young's  Unity kicks with some fine organ work! Eric Dolphy's Out To Lunch is a  shimmering, quirky, and uncontrollably beautiful avante-garde masterpiece.  Bobby Hutcherson's vibes shine bright on his tooth grinnin', hard hittin'  album, Stick Up! And Wayne Shorter roars on a handful of originals on Juju.There's just so much to look at. If you want more Miles, check out his  album In A Silent Way. Much different in sound than Kind of Blue, but that  melancholy, introspective spirit is there. So, if Kind of Blue is your  first and you want to look at some more, check some of these things out.  And don't you ever forget about Charlie Parker! Yardbird Suite is a great  place to start. You'd better be kidding if you say you dislike this one. It's probably the most revolutionary album in modern jazz, and probably always will be. On this 1959 classic, Miles Davis in association with pianist Bill Evans, introduces a new way of improvising, a new way of thinking, and this album make it possible for people to find a new way of listening.They started to base whole tunes on vamps with very few chords. "So What" is of course the main "theme" on this album, and it had a form like no other song by then. Today it's referred to as "modal jazz," and all kinds of styles have borrowed this idea since. Here there are only two chords: D-7 for 16 bars, the Eb-7 for 8 bars, and then 8 bars of D-7 again. No one had done such a thing in jazz before (but Coltrane later recorded an up-tempo piece with a different melody to this very form, called "Impressions"...also worth looking into)."Freddie Freeloader" is played basically over a blues form; the melody is played for 24 bars, and what makes this blues different from a normal rock-progression-blues is bar no.11&12. Listen...Then there is the soft ballad "Blue In Green", which, again has an odd form considering the music style and year of recording. There are 10 bars that repeat throughout the whole thing with a theoretically-not-so-logical-but-very-beutiful-chord-progression. It's kind of hard keeping track where the form starts over again, but it doesn't matter when you're listening to musicians like these."All Blues"...another classic (well, they all are), but this blues is played in 3/4, which had not been done a lot in jazz either. Charles Mingus did it in 1959 (the song "Better git it in your soul"), but I don't know if it was Miles or Mingus who first recorded a 3/4-blues. Anyway, the sessions were only a couple of weeks apart, and recorded in the same studio!"Flamenco Sketches"...a very nice, smooth piece, but rarely played as a cover by other musicians (unlike all other selections)...maybe because it's hard to find it as sheet music, I don't know, and I don't understand why it's never gotten as much attention as the rest of the songs, because it suites with the feeling of all the other tracks.On this album plays (one of my favorite sax-players of all time) John Coltrane, who in 1959, had not YET developed anything revolutionary on his instrument, but still played cool solos;Cannonball Adderley on alto, who has very different thinking in solo-playing than the rest of these men. He's got long lines with a lot of variation in these solos;Paul Chambers plays bass on the whole record. Listen to the walking bass-line on the first 16 bars of Miles' solo on "So What". Chambers plays a repeated figure with a little variation, making it sound like a separate melody underneath Miles' solo - quite unusual in walking-bass by this time. I could analyse his bass playing on this record until I've used up the maximum of 1000 words, do I don't think I'll get into more on him. To me, Chambers, Mingus, Carter, and Jaco are gods; this is also the first time, I believe, that Bill Evans performed on a Miles Davis album. He was not a very famous piano player at the time, unlike now, much thanks to his piano playing on this album. Evans is replaced by Wynton Kelly on "Freddie Freeloader" and Jimmy Cobb plays drums throughout. And Miles himself, a genius in modern jazz with a very personal approach to everything he plays...don't know where to start...just listen. Get yourself at least one copy of this album. This is probably where to start if you're new to the artist (unless you feel a need for chronology...but in that case you'd better have a big pile of green if you want to get to this album anytime soon. I recommended Kind of Blue more than any other album by Miles Davis. There should be a possability of rating this item with more than 5 stars. Bye-ya! I play this every Sunday morning because it is a very civilized way to begin the week. When you share this with others it opens up a whole new universe for them. Coltrane, Cannonball, Bill Evans...Coool Baby!A human being has not fully evolved until they have been exposed to this MASTERPIECE! It doesn't matter if you listen to Britney Spears, Napalm Death, the Rolling Stones, Marvin Gaye, Limp Bizkit, Garth Brooks, or Chopin. You'll like this album.If you've ever been alienated by the diffuse, seemingly scattered nature of Jazz (particularly with famous artists such as Charlie Parker or Dizzy Gillespie), fear not. This album is the standard-bearer of "Cool Jazz" - a more melodic, more ear pleasing style. The band is a veritable who's who for the Jazz uninitiated - Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Cannonball Adderly on the same album? Even those completely unfamiliar with the genre know these names.There is no excuse for EVERYONE to not own this album in some form - it's the single most influential album in virtually every form of modern music, and you need to hear it. I can hear the cries from the audiophiles now -- "Kind of Blue in Surround Sound... They've ruined it!" But in fact "they" haven't. As one of the most high-profile releases in the growing catalog of SACD, Miles Davis' Kind of Blue has been gently remixed for SACD in a multi-channel format that takes advantage of additional speakers (mostly front speakers) to create a wider and more open soundstage for an album that every true music enthusiast owns (possibly in several editions).The fear of a bad multi-channel mix is understandable, considering what could be done with this artistic performance. With the power to put John Coltrane ping-ponging in the rear speakers, it takes restraint, taste and respect to avoid overpowering the recorded performance with audio trickery. That restraint and taste are just what you will find on this SACD. The center channel is used to add height and width to the sound stage. In direct comparisons to a number of versions of remixed Kind of Blue that I own on CD, the SACD clearly takes the cake. No matter how well your speakers are angled for optimum imaging, you simply cannot get the stereo version to spread out the way you will hear it do on the SACD. I found it fun to highlight the differences for some friends over for cocktails recently. They think I am a bit crazy with all of my audio talk, but when they sat down to listen to the differences they could hear them clearly.I found that having additional space around the instruments brought to life new subtle details on a record where I thought I knew all of the subtle details. You can hear James Cobb spin his brushes on cymbals with such detail that you feel like you can hear the angle for which he attacks his set. The additional resolution from the SACD leads to increased overall smoothness in the sound without giving up one ounce of clarity. This is a definite advantage of SACD over CD or even LP (we aren't still talking about LP, are we?). When Davis mutes his trumpet, you can hear the tone get brighter, but it is never shrill or overpowering. While this never was a problem for me on past CD versions of the album, the additional resolution from the SACD format and an excellent mix makes the virtuoso performance just that much better.As far as the songs on the record go, you likely know them all by heart already. If you are buying or have invested in an SACD player at this point, it is very unlikely that you are unfamiliar with Kind of Blue. It is one of, if not the, most influential jazz records of all time and should be considered art, as well as a national treasure. Notable on the SACD version of the album is an alternate take of the last track, "Flamenco Sketches," which isn't found on most CD versions of Kind of Blue.The SACD remix was compiled from master tapes, using an all-tube, three-track machine, which was reportedly the type used for the original mix. Another improvement on the SACD release is correction of the tape speed, which fixes a pitch problem that caused musicians trying to play along with the record to end up pulling out their hair in frustration. As a guitar player, I never had the urge to try to play along with Kind of Blue, but I surmise that the improvements made in the pitch of the album, along with other improvements, all add up to the discernable difference you can hear on the SACD version.This record alone makes a strong argument as to why one could consider starting to upgrade their collection from CD to higher-resolution formats like SACD. The careful work done to remix and master the record, paired with the beautiful audio heard on SACD, makes it a must-own for any music lover, jazz fan and/or audio enthusiast. If it requires the investment in a new player, consider it a worthy expenditure to get this much closer to an important performance. -- Jerry Del Colliano, August 2001 Much has been said about the Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue." The album is the  subject of two books and any Miles Davis bio worth picking up devotes several pages to it's development and musical importance. The record is known for its simplicity and improvisation, as the sextet of jazz masters use a minimum amount of chords to create a mood that's profound, yet accessible. The original album consists of five tracks recorded in two days. Now, a half a century after its creation, there's a lot more.The musical paleontologists at Epic/Legacy have given this superior work the full treatment, expanding the music onto two CDs, with more Miles on a DVD, which includes a documentary on album and a rare television appearance of Miles and his band, from 1960. The box set also includes four essays, session transcripts and a 60-page book.The documentary, which is described as "newly produced," obviously isn't a recent as you might expect, as the late Ed Bradley comments on the influence of the album along with Bill Cosby, Herbie Hancock, Carlos Santanna and Q-Tip. The late Jackie McClean also it appears, making this the only element of this reissue of a 1958 record that could be called dated. A rare television appearance of Miles and the band is also included, catching Miles in his prime, living up to his legend even when he's smoking cigarettes in the background as his band plays.The songs on  "Kind Of Blue" were believed by many to have been recorded in one take, but among the "new" music is an alternate take of "Flamenco Sketches," along with shorter versions of album's five tracks and one false start. Jazz nerds are given further insight into the recording process through the brief dialogues between Davis and the record's producer and engineer, between the takes. This banter is transcribed and followed by analysis in the accompanying book. On the second disc is another session with the same musicians, which were first released together in 2000, and a 17 minute live version of the album's opener "So What."The voluminous criticism, discussion and the additions to this essential album threaten to overwhelm a work known for it's lack of complexity. The music authorities may have tried to drown the public with data and transcriptions, but they've provided the ultimate life preserver in the box set: A 180-gram blue vinyl version of the album. - Craig Belcher though there are over two hundred other reviews of the same album.  And  why?  Because anyone who has ever heard this recording feels they owe it  something.  I can't say anything that hasn't been said, but I just had to  throw in my love for this album, the greatest recording of all time.  This  album was my introduction to jazz, and while I know very little about  music theory, I know that while accessible, this album reaches depths  uncharted before it.  It is easily the most beautiful music ever played,  and the virtousity of its performers is unparrelled.  This album introduced  me to the lyricism of Bill Evans, possibly the greatest pianist in jazz  history, right up there with Bud Powell and Thelonoius Monk.  It showcases  two of the greatest sax players in jazz history, Coltrane and Adderley.  The rhythm section is unmatched, perfectly complimenting and driving the  music.  And then there's Miles, at his most subtle and lyrical best.  I am  now a huge fan of jazz, and all of these musicians, thanks to this album.  In fact, this album honestly changed my life and brought about the  evolution of my musical tastes.  Quite simply the greatest recording of all  time, a must own, and an example of how music can not only provide  listening ecstasy, but also bring meaning to, and enrich  peoples lives.  There I've said my piece, thank you Miles, Coltrane, Adderley, Bill, Cobb,  Wynton, and the bass player whose name I can't remember offhand, (Jimmy?).  An album like this compels anyone who has listened to it to share their  love of it with anyone who will listen. I already had 'Kind of Blue' and it was also a remastered edition. So why, you may ask, did I buy another one? Well, when I saw it in the music store, there was no hesitation on my part to fork out the money for it, after I read the back of the cd case. For one thing, there is an alternate take of 'Flamenco Sketches', never before released. Well that was enough there, to get me to buy. But add to that the much-improved sound. As it states on the cover, the earlier remasterings sounded thin. This reissue was remixed on an all-tube three-track machine. Now the instruments sound rich and full, like they were meant to. And finally, there was a problem with the earlier versions of this album, and that is, that 3 tunes, 'So What', 'Freddie Freeloader' and 'Blue in Green', were in the wrong key, as one of the three-track machines used to record them was running slightly slow, and the master takes used on the LP were pulled from the reels recorded on that machine, which meant that the original album and all subsequent reissues were recorded at the wrong speed, which made all the pitches slighty sharper than they should be. So this reissue now has the album sounding rich and true to life and right on key. So right there are 3 perfectly good reasons to re-buy this masterpiece even if you already own an older copy. Oh...and did I also mention the wonderful booklet packed with photos and 2 essays? One by Bill Evans and one by Robert Palmer. 'Nuff said! This is one of those albums that requires absolutely no thought whatsoever. It is a work of pure genius by a bunch of improvising musicians at the height of their powers. This is probably the album that has turned more people onto jazz than any other. Never a bad thing... I'm listening to it as I write this (as I have done every few days ever since I first bought it 20 years ago) and every note sounds as perfect now as it did then. Except that the remastering has done wonders for the sound quality, so it actually sounds a lot better than it did then. The instruments all have real definition now.As for the performances -  Miles was never better on both muted and open horn - the muted horn on "Blue in  Green'" and "Flamenco Sketches" is particularly beautiful. His open horn playing on "So what" and "Freddie Freeloader" is stunning in its openness and clarity of expression. Coltrane's solos are simply awesome. I also own much of his recorded output, and this ranks with the absolute best of it. He takes amazing risks - really hangs it all out - and yet every note is perfect. The inventiveness combined with the technical mastery is mind-blowing. Adderley is funky and equally inventive. This album caused me to seek out much more of his material. His solos are masterpieces of conciseness and melodic invention. He, as with the others, can be heard really thinking on his feet, and never putting a foot wrong. Evans is the still point around which this universe revolves. His solos are stunning. Great economy and expressiveness rolled into one. The rhythm section swings effortlessly, driving the point home in the best way possible.All in all, a piece of heaven. The more I hear it, the more I like it - still - after 20 years.Buy it. You will NEVER EVER regret it. It may change the way you listen forever, as it has with me.            You know when something like this genre is simply awesome when it is listed at #87 on the top bought cd's on amazon.com for today, December 20, 2005. That just amazes me because this cd will never lose its powerful meaning, for being put out so many years ago. Miles Davis as many know was original and there will never be anyone like him ever again. I get chills everytime when Miles hits the first note of "So What" I enjoy taking periodical visits to heaven quite often, because you can never go wrong with COOL AND TRANE An album can be a classic for many reasons. It made a contribution to music. It was the first of its kind. It historically represents an era in music, and in our world.Our world is now one of over exposure. We can hear and buy any music, any time. And as more musical cleche's are repeated, we hear their sources, and say "So wh.........." Let's get back to thatKind Of Blue by Miles Davis is over fifty years old. So much jazz has come from it, it sounds like so much jazz. But go back to Kind Of Blue and it sounds like jazz of the ages. Jazz of the ages that could have made yesterday. Today. Tomorrow.Miles Davis worked with Charlie Parker in the late 1940s and by the start of the next decade was a fixture in jazz. But he was not happy with being a fixture--being an inventor was more his style. After going home in 1954 to get better from the heroin addiction that killed so many of his contemporaries, he rolled up his sleeves and went to work.Ironic that his work was the polar opposite of the harmonically complex be-bop he cut teeth on. Kind Of Blue is the essence of simplicity. Play carefully in a few chords. Make less everything.Listen to "So What," perhaps this master's signature piece. This soft masterwork is two chords, separated only by a semitone. The soft dynamics and perfect solos of Davis, John Coltrane and Cannonball Addrerly fill the space, using it perfectly. There is actually plenty of complexity, invention, but it is provided by the amazing ability of these musicians to improvise, hold back, shape the space.Listen again and my technicalities will mean nothing. "So What" is a walk in the park, hot day ice water. Its progression  so logical, it is inevitable. Music of perfect ease. Floating."Freddie Freeloader," "Blue Is Green," these are blues, and at three or four chords each, the most complex compositions on Kind Of Blue. Can you believe that? It makes more sense considering that it is not the simplicity, but how sublime these players make the simplicity sound.I could name other tracks, but it is the premise that the whole album works on--exploring all the possibilities of a few chords-that makes Kind Of Blue vital.You can listen as background, you can listen as musical education. You can listen as meditation. You can listen on so many levels at once, I am sure you can find those I have not-yet.But why do you listen? I don't know. So What? Just listen to Kind Of Blue. Kind of BlueMiles DavisI fell absolutely in love with the song "All Blues" on "Kind of Blue" when it was played one night at our local pub.  I rate "All Blues" in my top 5 songs of all time, of any genre.  Rolling Stone put "Kind of Blue" at number 12 in their 2003 "Top 500 Albums of All Time" feature.Each jazz song I hear is compared to All Blues.  None really come close, even today (more than a decade after my first listen of it).  Now, I can honestly say that I am not any sort of jazz aficionado nor expert, but I know what I like and I like to think I know a good groove."So What" - This song will transport you to a seedy and smoky lounge where all things cool are happening or are just about to happen."Freddie Freeloader" - It takes me to a time and place found frequently depicted in the movies, but not usually experienced in real life (except when listening to Kind of Blue).Kind of Blue is Life tasted with expectations high, but Lipstick stains on collared shirts; the booze and the cards left behind for a night of smooth love making.  An adventure awaits.  The boys are all around.  Something is about to happen, but we are too cool to even bother."Blue in Green" - With our toes tapping and our heads moving back and forth we sit mesmerized by his playing and the sounds entering our ears.  A warm feeling comes over us and we smile a knowing smile.  Its cooool.  The piano is played and that big base keeps time with the drums.  Its cooool."All Blues" Sitting with your friends at a bar having a drink, smoking a stogie.  Laughing and having a good time talking about nothin' and everything in between.There are no iPods in this world.  Pop music doesn't exist in this world."Flamenco Sketches"  Men were men and a lady was a lady.  A man takea his woman in his arms and looks into her eyes with a deep knowing that she is the one for him and he for her.  They kiss.  A passion is ignited by their lips meeting and the music softly playing in the background."Flamenco Sketches (Alternate Take)" - They take a last sip from almost finished gin and tonics and slip into the bedroom for a night cap. The reason that I'm kind of blue is because there are some people who will never even hear Kind of Blue......because it was recorded fifty years ago and they think that it will sound dated.WRONG! It sounds as cool and modern as any album recorded today. In fact, this sounds so clear and so fresh that it might be surprising to new listeners that it wasn't recorded recently....because they have been intimidated by jazz purists who have told them that they will not be able to understand or enjoy this music because they don't know anything about jazz.WRONG! You don't have to know the first thing about jazz to be able to enjoy this soulful classic. It's music. If you're interested in jazz, this is the first place that you want to go. As with all music, knowing more about the subject will increase your enjoyment; but any novice who wants to listen to great jazz should be able to get right into the largely improvised Kind of Blue without any problems.Kind of Blue (1959) is well-known in jazz circles as "The Bible of Modern Jazz", and it's influence on jazz and modern music in general is unparalleled. It profoundly impacted the prodigious career of Miles Davis as it literally redefined the jazz world and became one of the best-selling jazz albums in history. It changed the game.The legendary musicians who played on these sessions include bandleader Miles Davis on trumpet, John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Julian "Cannonball" Adderly on alto saxophone, Paul Chambers on bass, Jimmy Cobb on drums, and Bill Evans/Wynton Kelly on piano.The music on this disc is atmospheric, cool, moody, contemplative, sleek and sophisticated. It takes the listener on a historic journey to the places in the mind where jazz reigns supreme. It swirls and soars while it soothes and surprises. It flies across the calm moonlit evening skyline and comes back to land on a wet neon-lit street corner at midnight. Thoughtfully, wonderfully.So why not find out why everybody has been talking about Kind of Blue for the last fifty years? If you want the best that jazz has to offer, here you go. And don't let those purists scare you! This album is incredible , amazing . It doesn't happen very often one recording reachs so cosmic heights .You may consider a simple account about this statement.Think in I love Paris (Michel Legrand)(see my review) . In this case Davis is present in the recording session , and we are just talking about the supreme jewel of the instrumental music in any time . I mean , if I love Paris (made in 1954) reached this status (years before A kind of blue) , you must agree with me that Miles Davis owned the magic playing , moreover, the poetic level (and when I talk about poetry , I mean the greek sense of the term , which is creation ).Specifically , Davis was a very illustrated man , with a strong introspective approach . The notes are there , but the scope is the difference , the velvet touch , the exact expressiveness and the precise instant in what the note must sound vibrato or languish . Davis played music as he would be making a film, writing a book  or painting , his trumpet was a brush , a pen or a script according the case .Notice for instance the Davis sound . I mean Davis was original because he goes to the origin , and transforms the notes , making them "sing" . There are other examples in jazz such as Stan Getz in the saxophone , Wes Montgomery in the guitar or Bill Evans in the piano .In Davis there was a deep sense of the expression and the wholeness meaning about jazz represents : this sense of freedom , and also a wide spectre of changing sensations , loneliness , happiness , sadness , anguish , desperation or seduction . This gradual sense of the tonal color about every note he played , you may find in the classical music giants , like Casals in the cello playing the Bach suites , Sandor Vegh conducting Mozart or Furtwangler conducting Beethoven or Bruckner , or Lipatti playing Chopin waltz . The sense of the expression and the real presence of commitment to achieve one specific sound and no other one.A Kind of Blue will be a reference standard not only for many years but also centuries .I have not any kind of doubt about that. Why is this fruit of a singular recording session still so highly touted and such a consistent seller, still such a monster going on half a century later? The short answer is "Virtuosity and Revolution (read, Innovation)." Oh, and let me not forget the root cause, contained in Duke Ellington's adjuration (as valid today as when my parents were pups), "It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing!"Coming up, I was advised that jazz is an acquired taste, like caviar (which, however, I liked the first I tried it, and I still don't care for much fishy). Jazz appreciation was considered an emblem of sophistication and maturity. I knew I was grown when I finally "discovered" Lady Day. (My parents had been playing her records for years and my callow ears couldn't stand the sound of her voice!)Likewise Miles. My father had albums like BALLADS and QUIET NIGHTS, QUIET STARS in his collection, but I didn't want to hear it. Coming out of college in 1970, though, I was getting into LIVE/EVIL (mostly due to the influence of peers, ..., and rock crossovers like Sly, Hendrix, the Isley Brothers, and Parliament/Fundadelic.) I became a freak for ON THE CORNER. But when an older dude chided me for stating JACK JOHNSON was my absolute favorite Miles album--"What? That's all the Miles you've heard?!"--I had to step back and take stock. I mean, I wanted to be down with the down musical crowd I was hanging with.Epiphany came during a weekend at my parents' house. Late one night, up by myself, I slipped MY FUNNY VALENTINE--a record of a live 1964 concert at Carnegie Hall--onto the quad deck and tripped out. Hmm, I said to myself, this is deep! I smuggled the album out of my father's house and into my collection. (Two years later I did 'fess up. "I wondered what happened to that record," he said. He smiled. His boy! I never gave the record back.)Maybe it's true that we're addicted for life, taste-wise, to the music we heard as kids; that becomes the yardstick by which we measure "good music." Miles' music began to make an impression on me in my early 20s. To this day--from vinyl to cassettes to CDs--KIND OF BLUE and SKETCHES OF SPAIN, particularly, have formed the bedrock of my music collection. Fundamental. So why?One, I respect the creative effort. Miles' KIND OF BLUE ensemble was one of what he considered his two all-time great bands. (The other is the early 60s Herbie Hancock/Ron Carter/teenaged Tony Williams rhythm section, with first George Coleman, then later Wayne Shorter on sax.) Everyone could flat out play! Then, consider the legendary circumstances: Miles walks into the studio not with arrangements, but ideas jotted on scraps of paper. "You play this . . . You play this . . ." They proceed to play and four of the five tunes are recorded in one take; the fifth tune in two takes. Unheard of! Not to mention stuff like all the musicians being in the same room at the same time, within sight of each other--no multitracking, no overdubs, no electronic manipulation of the "product" by imperious producers and engineers. Think about the extraordinary rapport, even trust, that had to exist among this group of musicians . . .Then, there's the musical revolution thing. In his autobiography, Miles boasts, "I've changed the direction of music five or six times!" Well, in this session--basing his tunes on a modal rather than traditional harmonic chord structure--Miles was working on change #2 or so. A very different sound. Miles (bless his Geminian heart!) periodically liked to shake things up, push the musical envelope. But the key lies in the album title. Again, in his autobiography, he confesses his life and career long obsession has been the pursuit of the blues--his earliest and most enduring musical influence. You can hear it so clearly in his last albums (especially STAR PEOPLE!) But what's going on here is kinds of blues--Miles transcending and extending "classic" ... big band style blues, with other influences seasoning the mix. I mean, "Flamenco Blues"? What would an Iberian inflected blues sound like? Miles gives it a try--THAT'S revolutionary!And then, like I said, the whole brew swings. The tempos, the moods may vary--that's the nature of the blues, no matter how hard core--but the attitude is there. And, fact is, the music doesn't have to THUMP to have pulse. (But for sheer wicked pulse, "Freddie Freeloader" is and has always been my favorite cut.) On the other hand, it has power to soothe--"balm of hurt minds . . . sore labor's bath . . ."OK, you can tell I love the album and that's not likely to change in this life. I've been grooving to it for 25 years. Remarkable thing is, I nearly always hear something different; even when I don't, it doesn't fail to move me somehow. My toes  tap, my face gives way to a wicked pleasure grin--I feel alive! As the word used to be back in the day, the music is "sayin' somethin'!" Now that is good music . . . If you could only own one record in your life, this would be it.The contrarian in me would say, upon reading all these blissed-out reviews including my own, that Kind of Blue must be one of those vastly overhyped,  puffed up faux masterpieces that our culture is so good at cranking out and  then deservedly forgetting as soon as the next Big Mac rolls off the  assembly line.But, every now and then, someone retrieves a bit of the  sun and hands it to us. I recall driving along I-40 in Arizona 15 years ago  as I approached the exit for the Grand Canyon. Something in me said, oh  what the hell I'll drive over and see it and be back on the road in a  jiffy. "Grand," huh? Yeah, right.Well, I got there and  wandered around speechless for a few hours, the hair on my neck standing  up, scolding myself for ever having been so cynical. How could I possibly  have doubted something like this, I wondered.Kind of Blue is a similar  mounument. It stands with the world's greatest music, literature,  architecture and even the natural wonders. Like that hole out in Arizona,  it is too grand, too complex, too sublime to ever really be adequately  described or appreciated.I'd recommend to any newcomers who want to  progress beyond this record to simply go out and buy recordings not only by  Miles himself, but by others in the group that made Kind of Blue. All of  the "sidemen" on this record were titans in their own right.Everyone's got their favorites, and mine is Bill Evans. I especially  love "Trio '65." First though, you need to have Kind of Blue. All  roads in jazz begin and end there.One last thing: you don't have to  know or like jazz to fall in love with this record. It's a masterpiece that  needs no introduction or explanation. Reviews like this one are ants next  to a giant ... the music says it all. UPDATE - 23 August 2015The version of Kind Of Blue available when I first wrote this review is now out of print, and there still seems to be confusion about which release to get. So, here's a re-write/update...Considered to be one of the Holy Trinity of Jazz (Armstrong & Ellington, since you asked), Davis had a pretty tough gig to continue inventing and innovating as a musician, in a music form that probably places a higher demand on inventiveness (in the form of improvisation) than any other.Davis landed at Columbia (now Sony) records in 1955, with Kind of Blue being his sixth record for them. To rewind a bit, Davis dropped out of Juilliard, and started playing professionally at age 18. By 20, he's recorded as a band leader. At 22, he helps invent Cool Jazz. By the time he's cutting Kind of Blue, he's 33 years of age, cut a few dozen LPs for three different labels, and kicked a heroin habit. What, exactly, is there left to do?Go Modal. Bring in a mix of musicians that have great instincts. And get ready to improvise. Without going into some kind of track-by-track analysis, Kind of Blue is easy on the nerves, and a feast for the ears (more along that line later). If you are new to Jazz, Kind of Blue is The Jazz Record For People Who Don't Like Jazz. If you are new to Davis' music, this is the place to start.While Kind of Blue is a perfect example of the Jazz form, it has taken Sony a few tries to get it right. Originally, the tapes for the first side ran a little fast. So, musicians in general, and trumpet players in particular who tried to play along with the record would get frustrated because while they could match the tempo, but they couldn't figure out the pitch...What follows is a very abbreviated history on releases (versions) of this record.The original CD release (tagged Jazz Masterpieces in the upper right-hand corner of the front cover) sounds like it was mastered using an EQ curve for cassette playback. And they did not make the speed correction for the first side. You don't want that one.The next Sony issue was part of the initial release of their Mastersounds titles. Using a gold disc and Super Bit Mapping, there is a sonic improvement, and they did make the speed correction for the first "side." Even with the improvements, the Mastersounds release is sonically inferior to an LP release of the time, and way more expensive. You don't want that one either.In 1997, for the first time, the original 3-track masters were used, and played back on the same kind of tape deck used to track the original sessions. Sound quality on this release blows any previous CD attempts out of the water. The release was speed corrected, and included a bonus track (an alternate take of Flamenco Sketches). The 1997 issue is dated as such, has a catalog number of CK64935, and a "matrix number" of DIDP089266 (found on the disc, near the spindle hole). This is the CD release you want. That said, please continue reading.The next CD release was for the 50th Anniversary. The sound quality is a big step down from the 1997 release: Lots of compression, and plenty of distortion. You do not want that release. I think Sony is now using the 50th Anniversary Edition master for the regular catalog issue. Sorry, I can't remember what the year is on this release. In short, if you are going with a CD release, make sure it's dated 1997 and you will be fine.About the original Sony SACD release (I only listen to the two channel mix): It is considerably better sounding than the 1997 CD, and crushes all other CD releases into sonic dust. There are two other SACD releases I am aware of: A Japanese Stereo-only (speed-corrected, with the alternate Flamenco Sketches), and the MoFi hybrid disc (not sure about speed correction or multichannel. it does not have any extra tracks). I have not heard either of them, so, no comparison is offered.If you are set up to do playback from a hard drive, the high-resolution downloads from HDtracks downloads are not a bad way to go. While I think the Sony SACD sounds a little bit better than the stereo 24/192 release from HDtracks, the best sounding version of Kind of Blue I have ever heard is the HDtracks 24/192 transfer of the mono version. If you are not familiar with mono, your first listen to Kind of Blue in mono may have you thinking it sounds Kind of Flat. Part of what you are hearing are a number of phase problems being eliminated, since you are no longer hearing Coltrane prominent in one channel, with Davis prominent in the other. This album is just the best to put on when it's raining outside, when you're getting some homework or office work done, or when you just want to kick back and relax. I really love that the vinyl is blue. Great quality sleeve and everything sounded great on both sides. Miles walked into the studio that day with minimal arrangements, his men picked the order of the soloists and went for it. With Kind of Blue the jazz world was introduced to modal improvisation and one of the best examples of telepathic group mind ever recorded. The strikingly disparate personalities of the players blend together perfectly and every sublime note counts. Coltrane's entrance during So What? is my favorite moment in jazz. Pour a glass of wine, or roll a fatty, dim the lights and listen.             Couple weeks while I was in St.louis I stepped into a record store and asked for a good,all around jazz cd, the gave me KIND OF BLUE, he continued to say that this was Jazz101.he was so true Simply put...excellent sound quality! I have a 5.1 ELS sound system in my car, and this CD sounds as good as a DTS surround sound disk! This is the ideal Miles Davis disk to purchase! I love this album.  In my opinion, Jazz sounds best on vinyl.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and we have listened to it at least 20 times since then.  Great album. Amazing sound quality for the age of recording. Sounds better than the new Columbia vinyl. Piano is a bit more forward in the mix and the bass is a bit more woody.There is plenty tape hiss, but this is a good thing,  as they haven't buried the sonics under a layer of noise reduction. I was exaggerating a tiny bit when I called this the "Best Album Ever", but it's the best album in the jazz world (though Coltrane's Blue Train comes close). One listen to So What proved that Miles was, besides being an innovater and great trumpet player, skilled with a melody. Freddy Freeloader does nothing but confirm that, as does the beautiful Blue In Green. At 11:35, All Blues is by far the longest track on Kind of Blue and showcases the group's enormous talent. (then again, any band with Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans and Cannonball Adderly would be extremely talented). Last up is Flamenco Sketches, which is another fine song... if you can hear a note of it, that is. I don't mind quiet music (with the exception of soft-rock, which simply lacks substance), but Flamenco Sketches is very tough to hear. Still, it has a nice melody.And to the "MTV Supporter"... Finulanu is tired of babysitting people who don't know diddly about music! (so tired, in fact, that he's referring to himself in the third person, which normally drives him up the wall). Jessica Simpson is an obnoxious parody of herself who plays pop, and 50 Cent is a rapper. Oh, one more thing... no matter what the Gangsta Rap culture may lead you to believe, being shot does NOT make you a good musician.Anyway, if you like jazz, buy this! (Hell, if you like any type of music, buy this) and Milestones, also by Miles Davis. Miles made me a jazz fan, and he could very well do the same to you. Kind of Blue is arguably the best jazz album of all time. Some might say that it is the greatest album of all time, period, though I would not go quite that far. Nevertheless, I will prize this release as my very first Dualdisc DVD.The sound quality in this format is quite superb. Through my DVD player, I played the CD (Side 1) version of Kind of Blue and compared it with the Dualdisc 5.1 (Side 2) version. It turns out that they are both enjoyable; however, the 5.1 does add that nice dimension to Davis' cool, trumpet-blowing jazz.If you ever take the time to listen, you will be delighted by the advanced resolution in the sound quality and how the instrumentations are simultaneously separated and reverberated throughout the six channels. In terms of awesome sound quality, Kind of Blue never sounded so good. Again, if you prefer the 5.1 mix, you can listen to side 2, or if you are a self-proclaimed purist who prefers not having audio tampered in the least bit, then stay on Side 1.All in all, think of it as 2 for the price of 1. Regardless of the format, this Miles Davis classic is a must have! Our native art form-jazz is well represented by "Kind of Blue". The musicians were the greatest of their era -John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, etc. playing at an artistic peak, If you have only room for, say, a half  dozen jazz albums in your collection "Kind of Blue" easily makes the cut. Like Beethoven's String Quartets, it repays repeated and intense listening as well as sweet inspiration. This is truly a "desert island" disc. I cannot recommend it too highly for its color, inventive harmonies and dynamic, unique voices. "Kind of Blue" is also a wonderful starting point for the novice in American music. Miles Davis, in what is quite possibly the greatest jazz album ever recorded, delivers. Largely. The lineup of artists appearing on this album with Miles is an all-star group in itself: Adderley, Coltrane, Evans, Kelly, Chambers and Cobb could put out this album by themselves and still make it into the top albums ever.  The CD opens with a slow and dreamy introduction, Paul Chambers on bass and Bill Evans on piano in a light and airy interplay. Chambers kicks into a light swing groove and the most recognized song on the album begins, "So What." Amazing solos and a great time feel drive this tune home.  The second tune, "Freddie Freeloader," is an easy blues tune, with Wynton Kelly playing piano instead of Bill Evans. Kelly's bluesy approach to jazz piano fills well here, as his solo forces you to tap your foot to the beat.  "Blue in Green," the only song that Adderley does not play on, is a slow and melancholy song that can bore some listeners, but to the avid jazz fan, it is a treat. Coltrane's explosive and expressive solo is so good, it can make you listen over and over...  "All Blues" is another blues in 6/8. Miles' solo is, although simple, very interesting and broad. A light feel travels through this one always.  "Flamenco Sketches," the last song, is also a slow and light tune. It differs from "Blue in Green" in that all of the scales and chords used hint at Spanish and African musical ideas, allowing for some very interesting solos indeed.  The sixth track, an alternate take of "Flamenco Sketches," is the only complete take of a song from the entire "Kind of Blue" sessions.  Whether for a rainy day or a road trip, "Kind of Blue" is the ultimate addition to any jazz collection and a great listen any day of the year. I am a jazz novice, but can easily understand the importance of this album.  The legend plays with Coltrane on a sublime album.  Top quality jazz and trumpet play.  If you lover jazz, you already have this.  If you are looking to get into jazz, this is a great place to start. If I could only have one CD in my jazz collection (fortunately, I haven't had to make that choice; I have over 1,000), this would be it. This is the kind of album you can use to lure neophytes into the wonderful world of jazz. It's very melodic and accessible, while also being serious jazz played by some of the greatest artists of the genre (including Bill Evans on piano and John Coltrane on tenor sax). I have been listening to this album for over 30 years and I never get tired of it. There is almost no other music I can say that about.          If you have been recently turned onto Jazz and have found your way here, you have come to the Album/CD which all other straight-joe jazz albums are measured against.  This is not Acid Jazz or Kenny G -smooth jazz, this is the real stuff.  When you are ready to take the next step ~ check out WISPER NOT by Keith Jarrett & FIRSTLIGHT by the FGQ.  40-40 Jazzman things rise and fall among the building blocks of public culture, and along the flow of time in each individual's grasp of it.  funny how jazz, the one truly american music, has come and gone several times in a lifetime:  there it was and here it is again.  within that parameter, miles davis remains a constant  --  like coltrane, bird, mingus  -- and leaps immediately to mind when the word is spoken.  "kind of blue"  is one of the reasons, and you can get lost in it for the first time, or for the first time again. Let's see. You have Miles Davis at the height of cool, all-star musicians sitting in, great sound, great songs, and bonus material if you're interested.  If, like me, you ever played a trumpet or cornet, you need to hear this album.  It's how I wish I could have played.  And the price is great, too!  So go get this one; you will not be disappointed! There is little to add to what has been said, analyzed, proclaimed, etc etc about this music.  Timeless perhaps? Listening to this session is a relevation every time I hear it.  This is perhaps the truest definition of  modern jazz, and its influences are still heard in countless recordings  today.  Anything further on my part would be redundant. Kind of Blue is the ultimate jazz album.  Even for those not usually attuned to jazz cannot help but be compelled by its power. It can't be described in words but after listening to  the first track,"So What", you tell yourself "this is great".  The rest just  gets you hooked.If this is jazz, this must be Heaven. I had no idea! I have loved Jazz all my life, but somehow I seemed to pass this up. Then one day I just said I needed to put some Miles in my collection and I ordered "Kind of Blue"! I had the CD in my player for a week before I took it out. It is out of this world. A (now) good friend of mine gave me this CD with only these words: "Listen.  You will understand."  All the reviews we could write cannot even begin to tell the truth of this recording, so I will not try.  You must listen to understand.  When you do, you will know why all good  jazz collections start with Kind of Blue. With all of the praise that has been lavished on this incomparable CD the only thing that I would add is that if I could only take 5 of my over 700 cd's to a deserted island for a year Kind of Blue would be one of  them.If you don't like Jazz try this one.  And if you do and you don't  own this one... Shame on you. "Kind Of Blue" is a definitive masterpiece! Any serious fan of music must have of this historical groundbreaking album! Miles and Coltrane are together at their best! This is the "Gettysburg Address" of American Jazz! Without being repetitive from the other reviews, JUST BUY IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT! In spite of the recording quality, its a 50+ years mono recording, the technical quality its still amazing. Artistically, John coltrane is in total ascension as a solist and, later on, as a jazz frontman; Miles is in superb shape, just as he would for the rest of his life. You can't go wrong with this.  Masterful! You don't have to be a jazz enthusiast to appreciate this album, nor do you have to pretend you get it like with so many jazz albums. Turn it on, and let it take your mind to sweet and refreshing places. If you're on the fence about buying it, take the plunge...you'll listen to this album again and again. This album has it all; it's got fantastic playing, it is extremely catchy, and very engrossing all at the same time. I have only recently begun to enjoy jazz, and I still love this album. There is nothing more that I can say that has not been said before, but I will say this; BUY THIS ALBUM! You will love it. I am rather new to Miles Davis' music, but I am now a great fan after hearing this CD.  It has an awesome selection of slow to fast songs, and some outstanding instrumentals.  Of course, people that know this are aware of this already, but I do recommend this for really classic jazz/blues sounds. This is good music and should be heard by any one who knows this artist knew his kraft well. The recordings are nice and clear. Amazon s music selection is vast and to date, and I will be ordering more Good Music. This album is one of the most important pieces of recorded music, period.  What's more, it is eminently listenable on many levels.  It doesn't matter if you like Louis Armstrong, Justin Bieber, Mozart, the Grateful Dead, or Slayer for that matter -- you will love it and then some.Nothing needs to be added.  Nothing needs to be taken away.  The music just hangs there in the air around you as a sublime ethereal thing.  Austerity and lushness in an extraordinary dance.Additionally, this particular remaster does a fine job of bringing life to these incredible performances.  The soundstage is just right, and the levels are spot on.  All good, and then some! I have this on sacd and on cd. The best version is definitely the vinyl edition. This is as my title says the ultimate Miles. I feel every jazz fan and without a question every Miles fan should have this on vinyl, Please excuse me for I must put the needle to my favorite track If you're getting this then this review will not persuade you to get this album because obviously you already know that this is one the greatest albums of all time.Miles Davis on trumpet, John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderly on sax, Bill Evans on piano, Jimmy Cobb on drums & Paul Chambers on bass, what else could you ask for? With this album we're definately dealing with one of those "what more can one say" sort of situations when it comes to reviewing it,mainly because of it's acclaim for listeners outside the jazz sphere. But whatever it ended up being this is Miles and jazz at some of it's very finest. One of the greatest things about it is that it definately leaves creative impressions on you. Considering all the great musicianship that went into the creation of music such as the best known tunes on this album "So What" and "All Blues" alone and THAN actually get captured into the spirit of these song's modalities sounding so free and effortless.....your definately inspired to express yourself in some way. I am a painter who listens to music while I paint. The range I listen to is very diverse but when I am in the middle of a rendering that's particularly interesting I find myself drawn heavily towards listening to jazz and funk because,despite the division lines some people choose to put between them both styles of music over a free wheeling yet technically demanding style of music that is very fluid in tempo and rhythm. This being the beginning of modal jazz,where the harmonies and melodies were less structured that liquid quality that Jimmy Cobb,Paul Chambers and in particular those dramatic chord blocks of Bill Evans really do bring out the artist in you whatever the style of it happens to be. "Freddie Freeloader" is particularly interesting in that the song not only has more of an uptempo flavor of the song but it gives the opportunity for 'Trane and Cannonball to let loose on their saxes. Interestingly enough,even though Miles' whole "tugging at the ears softly" approch to his horn tends to take presidents in both his solos and the compositions themselves you can hear in 'Trane's many solos throughout this recording that his sound is actually beginning to edge into that free spirited and transcendent style of playing that would culminate six years after this on his own A Love Supreme. Both the original and alternate take of "Flamenco Sketches" find Miles (and on the latter his sax players more over) really re-introducing that so important "spanish tinge" into the music. Miles was and would continue to be very deeply interested in Spanish melodies and styles of playing and this would be one of his most significant uses of the form aside from what he'd accomplish with Gil Evans on Sketches of Spain. "Blue In Green" is for sure the most "modal" of the songs as the bluesy tempo seems to stretch out into infinity. So many things were happening in jazz in the late 50's and early 60's. The most sigificant of the classic 33RPM long playing records were coming out at the time and with vigor. And that Miles and his various quartets and quintets were responsible for over a handfull of those records points to the legendary status his music and his general presense continues to have. In report card terms this disc is an A+ in an AP course.  Advanced musicians doing their best and pushing the envelope, all the while without alienating novice ears. It has a melancholy yet uplifting quality, the music has the rare ability to stir various emotions simulataneously. This is the standard classic jazz album by which all others are measured and whenever a debate concerning the best jazz album comes up this  1959 materpiece enters the discussion. All the superlatives aside, the all star group assembled is magnificent (check the personnel)but the music speaks for itself. This reissue is better than other versions because it includes the only alternate take during the session which was the beautiful "Flamenco Sketches"  whose music plays on eternally  on the lingering, crystalline  last note played  by Gil Evans. Another reason is that this is the first corrected version  of the music's sound quality because past issues were "off, " without getting to technical , suffice to say the speed of the tape was in error on all other versions. It may sound corny but this disc swings . It has an elegant grace found in too few records which is part of what makes it stand out from the rest. This is probablty my third or fourth vesion of this music and I never get tired of it, having played it probably more than other disc in my collection, night or day, it makes no difference. It is one of those that can be repeated several times consecutively without  ever becoming stagnant, it always sounds fresh. It is essential  music, desert island music if you will. It has influenced countless musicians in various unlikely genres. If you are new to jazz try this for the quintessential  masterpiece, if you haven't heard this in awhile or have an old copy get this version now. It is now not unusual to hear that this is THE best jazz record of all time. That is a proposition hard to confirm or reject. How does one compare the genius of Miles Davis with that of, say, Duke Ellington? Obviously, both are among the most major figures in jazz. And equally obviously this is among Miles's best recordings, and one of the most significant and best albums since World War II. I was lucky to be around 20 when this and many other major jazz records were produced, and to live in Amsterdam, where what was then called "modern jazz" enjoyed a warmly receptive response - one often at least as well-informed and discerning as in the US itself. In retrospect, I realise only too well that I lived, as a young listener, through one of the most satisfying and productive periods in jazz. This particular record struck us at the time as something unusual: a real "event", where the sum of the music was greater than its parts, and where some fundamentally innovative structures were introduced for the first time, with complete success. As for the personnel, Davis himself was already the leading trumpet player of his time, and had been for some years. One hears here all the most striking characteristics: the unique, immediately identifiable tone (whichever way it gets produced), the subtlety of his phrasing, and of his variation (even within individual notes), his inventiveness, and the extraordinary emotional RANGE of his playing. Coltrane was, on this record, a revelation. To me, he had too often sounded uncontrolled, but here he proved himself masterfully authoritative, producing deeply fulfilling well-structured music of great profundity, originality and power. I do not think he ever played better, even on later recordings, though some of those are stunning (e.g. "Africa Brass"). "Canonball" Adderley was at the least equal to the demanding task that he had to face in being the third horn. The rhythm section was eminently flexible and dynamic; this was the time when rhythm sections were becoming a good deal less "mechanical", and Miles's were always among the best. All in all, then, this was - and remains - an absolute classic, a  performance of enduring value, tremendous interest, imagination, vitality, and great feeling. One never ceases to enjoy this record, no matter how often one plays it, decade after decade. - Joost Daalder    How i missed this beautiful, yearning, soul-felt music for so many years is a mystery, but now i have it and i play it often.  It's my go-to choice when i want that deep comfort in times of stress. there is no greater jazz album;miles at the top of his game.  i bought this as an update to my existing album. the sound is great and it is an economical alternative to the more expensive reissues. THIS ALBUM CONTAINS A LOT OF GREAT TRUMPET PLAYING BY MILES AND SAX PLAYING BY JOHN COLTRANE. LET'S NOT FORGET THE MUSICIANS PLAYING. THIS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY JAZZ FAN YOU WON'T REGRET IT. I can only echo what others have said: An all-star lineup, incredible playing, classic tunes. The best introduction to the bop era for the new listeners, and an absolute must-own for any jazz fan. Some of the best music in our collection. The vinyl quality is outstanding. Don't think you'll be disappointed with anything about this album. Wife doesn't normally like this kind of jazz music, but she loves this album too.Thanks from the bottom of our hearts for this vinyl release- of one of the greatest music ever released. I hae always been a fan of the Blues it just has this sound to it that is instantly soothing and relaxing. I bought this after listening to it on youtube, I just had to have it and I am in no way disappointed. By far one of my favorite CD's and the fact that i actually purchased the CD is proof enough to just how much I fell in love with it. Highly recommended!!! I play some jazz as a hobby, and this has always been one of my favorite albums. We played at a friend's establishment, and this was my "Welcome to Jazz" gift for them that night. This is the quintessential jazz album for anyone to own.  Miles Davis was a musical genius and presents great standards with incredible solos.  I would recommend for jazz trumpeters to find transcriptions of his solos and really dig them apart to get inside Davis' improvisational mind.  Awesome album whether you're big into jazz or not! I have loved Miles since I was a little girl. This is the album I advise for folks buying thier first (or only) Miles.  I bravely got this for my boyfriend to add to his Jazz vinyl collection.  To my delight he absoluely LOVES Miles now.  In addition the pressing is superb.  Totally awesome on both the magical music and the hight quality vinyl pressing. I don't think I can add anything more profound or noteworthy regarding this record than what has already been posted by the 500 plus reviewers before me. I came into jazz late in life, having grown up listening to rock and roll through my late 30's. It was around the time of my 40th birthday that I first heard "So What" on a jazz radio station, and I was immediately drawn to this recording like a magnet. I raced into a record store and bought "Kind of Blue." I became an instant convert to jazz, almost overnight. I have probably listened to this record thousands of times during periods of both sorrow and joy. This record has kept me good company over the years. Interestingly, I seem to find something new and interesting with each repeated listening. Kind of Blue is a classic piece of art that certainly belongs in any record collection. The cast of characters who created this timeless recording reads like a who's who list of the greatest jazz musicians of the 20th century. The playing from Davis, Coltrane, Evans, et al is simply superb. Kind of Blue is arguably the single best jazz recording ever released. What more can I say? If you don't have it, go out and buy it today....This is essential music...
