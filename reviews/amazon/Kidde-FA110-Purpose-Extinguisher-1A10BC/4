 Did some research and these were a good cost for a good item. I have not had to use it, so in the event I do, I hope I do not have any issues. Instructions on the bottle are clear and easy.Will update my review if I use it. I'm happy to report that mine arrived fully assembled, fully charged, nothing was broken.I contacted the manufacturer to see how safe it would be for this thing to be in a hot car. After asking and explaining my question twice to the woman, she finally settled on 100 degrees, but didn't know if that was Celsius or Fahrenheit. I wouldn't count on this company providing any service whatsoever.You may find this link informative, as it provides more information on minimum heat tolerance for UL Listed fire extinguishers.articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/26/news/hw-48106 By other reviews some people experienced their fire extinguishers arriving damaged; mine was packaged well and arrived intact. I hung it up on the wall and I do have to say that was a bit difficult, but we managed to get it secured and hopefully I will never have to take it down. Appears if that ever happens, taking it down will be simple. Got this to keep in my vintage VW Beetle just in case of some kind of engine or interior fire emergency. Hey, old VW Beetles aren't the safest cars ever made! It's a goldiecocks size, not too bulky, not too small & mounted it easily beneath my dash for quick access if needed. So grateful I invested in this product because one of my rear drum brake shoes dislodged while driving on the freeway and the friction in the wheel made it catch fire. I pulled over immediately, grabbed the extinguisher swiftly, and put out the fire in seconds. No damage done other than needing a new brake shoe for the drum. Very satisfied with this product but be sure to educate yourself on the different classifications of extinguishers. Different types of fires require different types of extinguishers so while this worked for my brake, it would not effective for a kitchen grease fire, chemical fire or probably even an auto engine fire. Just a heads up on that issue. I received the item, but the gauge needle was on the line for EMPTY/FULL.  I called Amazon and they were able to replace it with one that the needle was clearly in the green.On the bottom of the first can, it had a manufacturing year of 2013.  Seeing that it's still December 2012, I was skeptical.  The new one is from 2012, so we're good.I've seen cheaper on sale at Menards (of course, just after I bought this), but those sales are few and far between.Whatever.This unit is a basic disposable fire extinguisher.  It's going to be made of materials that are not built like old Volvos.  It's made for one purpose - USE ONCE.Okay.  I just got it so I had about 12 seconds to get my family out of the house if fire is in our way.That or a small fire in the kitchen.You're not going to put out a 5-alarm with this thing.  But then again, that's not the point of this item. This is an ABC extinguisher, which, needless to say, I hope I never have to use.  However, the ABC type was advertised as really being a multi-type fire extinguisher.  And that's supposed to be good.  However, in reading the instructions, it says, if used on a stove, it can destroy the finish, never to be repaired, and it really didn't explain if this extinguisher can put out a gas fire.  I guess it's better to put out the fire before your house burns down, but I wouldn't expect the extinguisher to destroy my property.  I will keep it, but I am disappointed in some of the issues this extinguisher has.  Don't know if another one would be any better. Small and reasonably priced this is a supplemental fire extinguisher. It has a six year warranty but the gauge should be periodically checked to ensure it registers "full" on the dial. And, annually it should be turned upside down and given a shake or two to prevent the powder from settling. It will handle most basic household fires -- electrical equipment, flammable liquids and common combustibles like wood, paper, etc.The canister is metal but the trigger, pin, nozzle, etc. are all plastic. Plastic components keep costs down but they can break, making them potentially less reliable in an emergency. So, this unit should make a fine back-up extinguisher in the garage where a fire is less likely, and I have ordered a larger all-metal extinguisher for the kitchen. I just bought this product a couple days ago from posting this review. It arrived in a standard sealed box, had all the parts and even a wall mounting bracket upon inspection. I was afraid it was going to be too small but it seems to be decent size for the price and the  small house that we will be using it in. I will come back and update should anything change but I hope that I never have to use this and it sits behind our kitchen door for a long time. I ordered three of these as replacements for ones in my home that are going on 15yrs old.  So the box arrives and once opened I find all three covered in powder, not a good sign. I open the individual boxes and see that two of the three extinguishers have their trigger guards missing, and one of them has definitely discharged (the gauge reading "empty").  The other unit with the missing guard may or may not have discharged; there was some powder on it but the gauge still read "full" although it was closer to the "empty" than squarely on "full."  The third one was ok.  All three looked like they had a rough ride during shipping with holes in the boxes and dents in the cylinders.  I called Amazon and they put in a replacement order for the two extinguishers.On the upside for Kidde, I tested two of the three old extinguishers I've had since around 2002.  One had been in our garage in very hot conditions, the other in our home.  Both worked perfectly!  I'm hoping these new ones will last as long as my old ones did! I keep this in my truck for emergencies.  I used to think it was silly but then over time I have seen enough situations where I could have used one but did not have one like a camp fire getting out of control, a car fire under the hood, or the leaves catching fire under a grill.It is pretty short money when you consider how much you could help yourself or someone else in need and avert a disaster.           We bought two of these to replace old Kidde extinguishers that were way past their useful date.  Haven't had to use them but good to have if needed. I haven't had a small kitchen fire yet, but I'm going to assume it will work if the tenants in my house ever accidentally catch the kitchen on fire. Effectiveness pending as I haven't needed to use it yet, but it came promptly and was the product I was looking for for the price I was looking for. It was affordable and arrived in good condition. I have not had to use the device, but it seems to be well made and is small enough to stow away. I searched for a useful, well recommended, fire extinguisher and was pleased when it arrived.  Exactly as described and glad I have one on hand. Haven't used it (which is good) but it looks good as is. The mount could be better, but just a good piece of safety to have around the kitchen. I  haven't put 5 stars, because I haven't needed to try it out!  I  bought it because it is multi purpose.  Everyone should have at least one. What can you say about a fire extinguisher that I can't know how well it works until I use it on a fire? This unit was recalled and replaced. It arrived a day before it was expected. I have not used it yet and hope not to use it ever but everything looks good and it is well made. Never had to use it (knock on wood) but brings peace of mind having a few of these around the house just in case.  Best part is the price
