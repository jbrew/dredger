   This is a great fire extinguisher to have around the house.I even got to verify it works when my girlfriend started a little grease fire!When my brother bought his first house, this was in the new homeowner gift bag I got him. I don't know why I didn't have this in my kitchen already. Every home should have one if not more of these basic safety tools in their homes. My family put this in the house this year when my brain tumor came back this year. It is great and easy to use. We recently had a dryer fire due to lint build up. It was very scary and we almost burned the house down running to get a large bucket of water. After that decided it was time to get this extinguisher and keep it by the dryer just in case. Highly suggest it but have thankfully not had to actually use it and hopefully never will! The children are intrigued though so we need to store it in a hard to reach place! House hasn't burned down once since installing this extinguisher, no fires to put out but HEY, gotta start somewhere.  Important, and serious, point though...Kiddie had some sort of RECALL on this model so make sure when you get it to check their website and see if your serial number is affected.  We received a free replacement recently.  Also, the plastic bracket that comes with this unit is decent for wall mounting but the metal (optional) bracket is much much nicer and easier to remove the extinguisher when in a hurry.  Amazon has the metal bracket for $5 or $10 dollars I think. You can never be too safe, right? I've been a homeowner for about 10 years now, and somehow for most of that time, I managed not to know that you have to recharge or replace your fire extinguishers - if you have rechargeables, they have to be maintained every 6 years; if they're replaceable, every 12-13 years. Well, heck.I actually live in the house where I grew up, having remodeled and moved in after my mom passed away in 2004. When I moved in, I had literally no homeownership knowledge whatsoever. I've learned as I go, often the hard way. Thank goodness I didn't learn the hard way here!As soon as I learned about replacing fire extinguishers, I started doing my research to find the right units for our home. I bought these extinguishers (I ordered 3 of them) because they were reasonably-priced and had exceptional reviews.I now have one on every floor. These fire extinguishers are smaller than I expected, and as such, they take up less space than I anticipated. So I like that aspect quite a lot. While I have not had occasion to use them (thank goodness!), I do sleep a lot better at night knowing that if anything were to happen, I'd be ready.I am somewhat concerned by the reviewer who said that it didn't work for her. I don't know how one could know in advance whether it's going to work or not. From everything I have read, the only testing that one can do of a fire extinguisher is visual, so I take some comfort in the other reviewers who have said that this product saved their home or their neighbor's home. I bought two of these Fire Extinguishers for my home, which doubles as a daycare, one for each floor. I hope that I never have to use them, but I feel safer knowing that I have them around! Just watch for recalls because one of the ones that I bought had been recalled, but a quick form filled out to the manufacturer and they shipped a new one free of charge. Have to have one.  It can save lives.So I have tested this and it put out an outdoor bonfire.This is all you need.  I keep them properly hidden in my home to be able to get to them or a window.  Which ever you need 1st. I moved to a new apartment in the city and I was not aware about the existing policy by the management of bringing our own fire extinguisher in case of fire related accident. I dont know where to buy such but thank goodness I was able to encounter it here in Amazon! The fire extinguisher looks so elegant and does not make my room dull. COMES WITH A BRACKET. I don't know why the seller doesn't make it very apparent that it comes with a wall-mounting bracket. It had a hard plastic collar which carries most of the weight, as well as a flexible band about halfway down the cylinder to hold it against the wall. The 'button' that closes the band is hard to close, but very easy to pull open so you won't waste any time when the extinguisher is needed. The bracket is designed so that the status of the extinguisher -- in the green, meaning ready to use, or not -- is clearly displayed, just like in the picture.This is the second one I've had. I left the first one in my previous house. Even after 10 years of hanging on the wall, it was still in the green.By the way, my home owner's insurance claims that having a fire extinguisher (as well as ceiling sprinklers) qualifies me for a lower rate. Back when I owned a farm I kept five of these on hand.  But you need to keep them away from teenagers who can be both curious and adventurous. And boys can become fascinated by the sound and mess they spread around.  Knowing the dangers of fire one young fellow tested one "just to make sure it worked", and he found out that it did. Not wanting to take any chances, he decided to test them all.  After he was finished with his testing he reported that every one of them worked perfectly.  I suppose he considered it to be practice in case of a fire, but they were all now very empty.   As a volunteer firefighter, I have used several extinguishers in the past of different brands, types and sizes. We purchased a box of these at a local hardware store to give away as part of a grant we got. After testing one of the units due to curiosity, It performed flawlessly. You need to check the pressure every once in awhile, to ensure it will work. This unit is good for 12 years and at minimum, Shake it up every 6 months to prevent the powder from compacting.Tested and approved by our fire dept! It is tough to write a review about something you have never used and hope you never do use but I'll give it a try.  I figured that the two fire extinguishers we have are at least 15 years old, possibly older.  I bought one of these so see if it is good quality before replacing both.  When this arrived I took down the one in our garage and discovered it is identical to the old one.  Here's the reason for the 5 star rating.  There is a gauge that show the state of charge and obviously the new one is right up in the green zone.  Well, guess what?  The old one is still showing a full charge.  I think I am now going to have 3 fire extinguishers instead of 2. This is one of those difficult items to rate.  I hope to never have to use any of them, and as such, I cannot comment on their usefulness.I will say, however, that they appear to be in working order, and for the most part the needles appear to be within the fully-charged zone on the dials.Again, they do seem to be high quality with regard to their appearance, and I hope to never have to report back on them after needing to use them. This thing worked like a charm, even better than I expected. It put out the fire instantly, and saved my entire kitchen - and possibly the entire house - from going up in flames.Even though the label on the extinguisher says to spray continuously for 6-8 seconds, after less than 1/2 second the fire was completely out, and everything was covered with a fine layer of white dust.If I had one complaint it would be that cleaning up after using this is a MAJOR pain.However, a few hours and a lot of elbow grease later, we still have a roof over our heads, and a new extinguisher on order. I've not tested this.. so it's hard to give a 5 star rating. But the extinguisher seems very well made. Solid build. And I trust it.I will update this if my house burns down and it's to blame.Also, it comes with a simple wall mount. No hardware. Not upset by that.I actually plan to keep this in my car for the next x years. As I drive for a living and have numerous electronic mods to my car, this seems like the wise choice.If nothing else, This could be a great blunt object in a road rage altercation. OR a smoke screen!I'll update this when it expires, and make a video of the discharge. This arrived exactly as advertised. I feel safer knowing I have this if I need it. I bought four, two in the house and one in each car. The price was very reasonable. If it is the difference between getting one of the kids out in a fire, it is worth every penny and more. Setting a calendar reminder to check themeach month, and bring them to the fire department for a check once a year. I purchased this product for my home.  I needed something small enough to mount to the inside wall of my pantry.  This item does that.  It came properly pressurized and with a wall bracket.The only problem I saw was the bracket.  It did not come with any screws or hardware.  Plus, the bracket is made of plastic and a little flimsy.Other than that, it was delivered quickly and the product was undamaged...thank you. Just bought my third one! These are great for the house, car, garage, upstairs, basement... You get the picture. You can't play with fire safety and you need to have at least one of these close to where you might be if a fire breaks out in your home. I keep one on each floor of my home and you should too. Ive just seen a video of a guy that saw an accident on the highway while driving and put out a car fire saving a woman's life. Now I need one for my car. Better safe than sorry. A fire extinguisher, carbon monoxide and smoke detectors are a must in every household. I've used these a few times, from a VW engine fire, to burning curtainry to the next door neighbor who had a grease fire. All three three times it was the same Kidde as the one I have purchased today. Always st√†nd back and aim for the base of the flames. Sweep back and forth. That's the first thing you're taught in basic marine firefighting ( thanks India Tango Ballard ).Make sure after a few months you invert the unit and tap on the base to keep the chemicals mixed. Be safe everyone. We needed to purchase a small fire extingusher because my husband is on oxygen. They say they want one un our house at all times. I believe this to be a very nice brand. We have never used it and hope we never need it. So, I cannot tell about how it works. I can only say it looks to be of the same quality materials that others are made of.       We purchased this fire extinguisher to put in our kitchen just in case.  Hopefully we'll never have to use it, but I feel better knowing it is there in an emergency.  It's a good size -- fits right under our sink, or it comes with a wall mount if you have a good place to put it up. Well, it's hard to give a review on an item that I hate to never have to use.  The quality seems nice though, I do like that it has a plastic holder that you can screw in the wall and mount.  We have been needing one for a long time and this finally gives me a piece of mind. It's a fire extinguisher. I'm not sure how well it puts fires out as it's an item you purchase in hopes of not having to use it. Although, I have it mounted in a cargo trailer on a wall and it stays put and looks good. As far as my experience tells me, buy it. It's a great deal. I got two, one to test and one to store.  Test performed great!  Safeties were intuitive to remove and use.  I have no doubt anyone could figure it out in a panic.  And the apray was direct and intense.  I'm sure it could handle any early household fire.  I feel confident having it in my kitchen. we have lower home insurance rate if we have an extinguisher in the home and getting a new one is more cost effective than recharging the old one the old one had lost it's charge after over 10 years in the standby mode  01-01-2016 when I did my yearly check We have these in multiple locations around the house. Every house SHOULD Have a few of these around just in case. You never know what can and will happen and you should try to be prepared as best as possible! This ABC Extinguisher put out a Propane fire over the weekend that could have been a disaster. Within 5 seconds, all was well and the fire was out.  The Dry Chemical model suffocates the oxygen and stops the fire.  Model ABC covers trash, gas and propane, and electrical. A broad spectrum.Worth every penny - I used one and replaced it with 3 more of the same.  Protection. I like the weight of this one, as compared to larger ones.  It is very easy to use!  With several smaller canisters you can spread them around your home, and keep one in your car, boat and garage- a GOOD idea.  Having several smaller ones allows you to get to them quicker than having one large one you have to run to get in an emergency, and then drag it back with you to the scene of the fire.  Emergencies, running, stairs, darkness- they don't mix and it puts people at risk of additional injury by doing that.  The ones I purchased years ago, many years ago, still are fully charged and ready to go.  Safety Reminder- Please do check your extinguishers at least twice a year.  A good time to do it is when you change the batteries in your smoke detectors and set your clocks ahead or back for Daylight Savings. The mount keeps it securely attached to the wall. I have had it for 1 year and it is still fully pressurized. I keep it in my garage right by the door for easy access. I like that it mounts to the wall because I know exactly where it is. I also bought a can of foam spray to keep under the kitchen sink.This would also be great to keep in your car or truck, I had it there for several months during the summer and the heat didn't seem to do anything to it. My father in law gave us one of these for emergency situations. Well that time came when my gas grill caught on fire due to a grease fire. I had to spray this and I was extremely happy that I didn't burn my house down. I bought this to replace the original, I cant stress how important this was to have on hand.   Received this item within 4 days of ordering it. I have been searching for a affordable extinguisher this one fit the bill. Arrived full with a decent wall mount. I hope to never have to use it, but its always better to have something and not need it then to not have it at all. Ever since there was a fire in our neighborhood, I started making all the precautions to prevent fire and that's why I've been buying these fire extinguishers, we'll never when we would need to use it It has saved us from bigger troubles so many times already, this is a must in every household Fits right where our old kiddie fit inside of our snack closet; it's slightly lighter than the previous one and the wall mount is now plastic; but it seems to hold the extinguisher just fine. Haven't had to actually use it yet for a real emergency; but it's charged and seems to be in good shape. Price was also right; will keep an eye on it to see how long the charge lasts; as our previous "all metal" one went for many years. Although I haven't used this particular item yet, I've used this model before and this model works great.  I put out my kitchen fire like a smokey bear.  Everybody who cooks needs one of these under the kitchen sink! Its hard to tell the quality of a fire extinguisher unless you have to use one which I have fortunately have not. Kidde extinguishers have always maintained pressure past their expiration in my experience. Nice size, arrived perfectly in 2 days!! Easy to understand directions, simple device.  Mounting included if you want to hang it on a wall.  Feels good having this in my kitchen now, though I hope I never have to use it ;) I kept one of these under the kitchen sink for five years and never needed it. Then one day, I forgot to clean the drip pan on my stove and it caught fire. We were able to extinguish the fire immediately with this small, handy extinguisher. The mess from the spray was pretty easy to clean up and all we had to replace was the $8 drip pan. The small size makes it ideal for the kitchen. Know where it is and how to use it, so if you ever need it, you can put a fire out quickly. Bought these to keep in my cars.They are small and fit well in the car trunk.Hope I never have to use them.Yet they will help put out small electrical or grass fires.I keep one next to me when jump starting a car, just in case... I bought this in Dec 2013 since I had left my other extinguisher behind when I had moved, in 2012. So 2 1/2 months later, my son accidentally sets the toaster oven on fire and flames were going up the cabinets! Luckily I had purchased this, I have no idea what we would have done without it. I had never read the directions, but I knew to pull the pin, then I just aimed at the fire. No problem!! Put it right out. I purchased another one (they are one use only) for myself and one for my sister. I would advise getting at least 2 of these small ones, or bigger one for a larger house.    I hope i never need to use it but it looks rather sturdy and fits nicely in my upstairs linen closet.  I already had one for downstairs which is mounted in the kitchen closet.  That one holds securely on the wall attachment.  I did not have room on the wall upstairs so i have it on a shelf.  With it's flat bottom this was not an issue.  I recommend having one for each floor of your home. As a retired firefighter I am careful of fire hazards and ever mindful of how to be prepared in case of a fire.  Kidde produces a quality product and as long as the consumer is aware that maintenance of any fire extinguisher is necessary, I wouldendorse this extinguisher.  Remember that annual maintenance of any extinguisher is necessary and that extinguishers do not last forever. I recently moved to an apartment with a gas stove. As I had only used electric stoves in the past, the gas stove makes me nervous in some aspects. I bought this fire extinguisher in case of a kitchen fire. Youtube a grease fire if you have never seen one. It is really scary unless you have an extinguisher, gallons of baking soda, or a perfect fitting lid. YOU CAN'T USE WATER ON A GREASE FIRE. Also, Kidde sells a special kitchen extinguisher for a little bit more, but it didn't seem to be useful for other sorts of fires. This extinguisher is the generic fire, ABC, kind. Hope I've never get to use it, but looks good so far and has a mount. Perfect to keep in the car or for a small apartment. Not sure it would work well with a large fire, but feel good enough for a quick emergency This is truly a multi-purpose item, bringing with it a host of possibilities.Some of its nearly infinite applications:BludgeonmentTruncheoningCudgelryDoorstoppingWheeled PropulsionFake Snow (Christmas)Fake Snow (Hannukah)Fake Snow (Other)Punctuating StatementsFrightening Intruders (Standard)Frightening Intruders (Ethnic)Birthday PartiesSurprise Greetings...and more!Not great with fires. I have 4 of these all around the house. One in the kitchen, by the basement stairs, on the 2nd floor of the house, and by the living room.  You just never know when you might need one....so I put one in close proximity to each room of the house.  Planning on getting another two for my work station in the basement and in the garage. I haven't used this product but it is a great size to fit underneath the kitchen counter in case of emergency.  Comes with clear instructions on how to use it in case we ever do need it.  Highly suggested for anyone moving into their first apartment - we got ours *after* we set our BBQ on fire (oops) but it would have been much better to have before hand. i hope i never have to use another one.  this did not fit in my OEM trailer slot.  no problem .  will work under my sink.  the OEM fire extinguisher put out my engine fire.  needed a replacement.  best to shake them up every six months. I like the mounting bracket and the "traditional" look of this product.  I have the white kitchen model and the red general purpose model.  Make sure you place it on the near side of the kitchen instead of the far side!  You want easy access in case of emergency... We have had NO fire protection until ordering these extinguishers and feel so relieved to have them in our home now. The winter has been so bitter cold and our city has had a recent rash of home fires so we determined to increase our safety factor. The ideal is that we never have to use them - but - do feel safer with them in the house.   As I'm buying a house, I'm working on buying the 20 million things you need that you don't need in an apartment.  Fire extinguisher seems like one of those things.What can I say, I have no idea how it works.  If I ever update this review, it'll either be "works awesome" or "my house burned down.  don't buy".Definitely recommend getting one though, safety and prevention. I haven't actually had to use this yet, and hopefully I never will, but it provides a great peace of mind that I have an actual working fire extinguisher in my home. It is solidly built, and comes with a mounting bracket so that you can attach it to your wall. It's just what I wanted. Moving into a new house, I bought this on a whim figuring it'd be good to have around, but that I'd probably never need to use that.  Flash forward to today, our oven caught on fire as I was preheating it, and this little guy put it out very quick.  Without it, I'm quite sure more damage would've been caused.  Very pleased, and will be purchasing another one (and hopefully won't have to use it). We purchased enough to keep one in each car (recommendation from dad) and one in kitchen and one upstairs. Can't put a price on safety. These are a nice size- enough to do the job but not terribly bulky. Hopefully, will never have to use. The gauge is nice as it indicates the pressure is OK. I had to use it on bees.  We were in the pool and killed some bees that were by the ice chest and before we new it they brought in back up and I mean back up.  My wife ran in the house before all the bee support arrived but I was stuck in the pool.  The bees came in a pack as I hid under the grotto water slide we have and tried to wait them out as hours went by and they just flew back and forth waiting for me to come out.  I had my wife throw this extinguisher in the pool and I sprayed all the way to the house making a huge cloud of powder that kept the bees from stinging me.I am ordering a new one right now.  I know most use them for a fire but thought I would share my story and if you ever get cornered with bees after you use this baby! The two fire extinguishers arrived with the year of 2014 stamped on them and they were fully charged.  They came with a plastic mount that is also USCG approved for marine use too.  Others complained that they experienced shipping damage but mine were in great shape. This product again came with a deal I couldn't ignore. It's light weight & compact!  It's my backup for my home which I hope I never have to use but would also be great for camping trips or having outside next to that grill just in case of an emergency while grilling up those wonderful summer foods on the grill.  Highly recommend this product for purchase. Every Home should have a fire extinguisher and after moving in to my new manufactured home I immediately went to Amazon to procure one. I is nicely packaged but the secure band can be a pain to latch. You need strong fingers to execute the latch for the wall mount Purchased this for a new home, as a matter of fact, purchased two of these.  The holder for the wall is nice.  One is in the garage and one is in the hallway of my home.  Hopefully I never have to use it to find out how easy it is but I am pleased I have it.  The name alone is what sold me.  Their reputation. Works good as I had it stored for 1 year then took it camping so I could put out my campfire in case it got windy which it did, and it worked great. It took the whole bottle to put out the fire though which was pretty big so this extinguisher would only help with a small fire or possibly help you escape through a window with a bedroom fire.        Perfect for part of our automotive emergency pack. Purchased for our shed, wonderful price great item it also includes wall mount, though, not screws. This is an ABC extinguisher meaning it works on paper/wood, liquids, and electrical fires. The previous one we had was still good after 10 years. I bought this as a replacement because I felt it was time.If you don't have a fire extinguisher in your home, shame on you. This is a good one. Quick delivery and the price was just right. Bought this for our new home.  It's small and fits well under the kitchen sink for easy storage.  It can also be mounted on the wall or somewhere for easier access.  It might be good to keep in a car, but I think it's a little too big unless you have ample storage space so it's not always visible. Already used it to stop a kitchen fire. lowes got you beat in store price 21.00 Perfect for my daughters apartment! A Good Show case Item to reduce home insurance. This product cost me $25.00 but got saving in insurance $35.00. so I am happy with out using this product.   It looks beautiful and makes a wonderful conversation piece in my apartment. I obviously hope to never be able to provide a review of the actual contents as that would mean my house is burning down. We live in an old house so we bought two of these just in case something was to happen. We thankfully haven't had to use them yet but they look just like the picture and have instructions included Never used it, but it comes as described in the ad. Great to keep under the sink in case of emergencies.We purchased this AFTER we had a scare when the grill burst into a giant flame. I ordered this after seeing a thread on "What topic should everyone have in their home?" This is a multi-use extinguisher. Hopefully I'll never use it, but it is good to have in the home. Well, it certainly appears to be a fire extinguisher but I will only find out for sure if I have a fire. Hopefully, it stays mounted on the wall and I never find out if it actually works or not. Haven't had to use this yet, thank god but there was a recall on the one I received and I was promptly sent a replacement no questions asked by the manufacturer. Would recommend these to others. Kinda hard to review this, until you use it - and due to the nature of the product, you kinda hope you never have to use it.  I'll assume that it's in good working order.  It looks like it is. And I hope I never do! It fit easily under the backseat in my F150 and now I have one wherever I go. I had originally bought it for my trailer but figured the truck was a better place for it. Luckily we have not had to use this but it does fit nicely under a small kitchen sink and seems to be of good quality; its heavy and seems like your standard fire extinguisher, nothing cheap. I haven't actually had cause to use the fire extinguisher yet (thankfully!), but it seems to have a good, solid construction and I like that it has a long life without needing to replace it.   A good item to have around the house. Although I hope I never have to use, its never a bad idea to have it. Although shipping was a little slow, item came fully charged and ready to-go I ordered two. I gave it that rating because they look good. I have no way to know how well they work - until I have a fire, which I hope is never. They are easy to attach to the wall. perfect for the kitchen Perfect size for a car. Perfect for keeping in your car. I had to get one in order to drive my truck in the beach and this one is great. Haven't had to use it yet and if I never do it was worth the money. No problem with order or receiving. The box it came in was beat to death, but everything was there. Seems FedEx likes to play soccer with the packages, which I find a lot of times. Used this up on a small grass fire on the side of the road on my way home from the market.It worked well enough but I since ordered a refillable extinguisher with bigger capacity. Assuming it will work if ever needed - everyone should have at least one in their house/apartment. It could reduce your home owners/renters insurance. Seems to be of good quality. thought I'd gotten extinguishers suitable for automotive use, but now I have extras for the house.  Or I could give one as a gift!  Kidde makes great product.  I'm quite pleased. This a perfect extinguisher for small fires. I purchased for a sense of security in the event a small fire was to happen in my kitchen. I keep it under the cabinet in my kitchen.  Ordered the Kidde Smoke/Carbon Monoxide Alarm.  I have had Kidde for 20 years.  Performs as expected, consumer friendly, easy to install.  You can't go wrong with these products. Haven't "tested" it yet, hopefully never will.Fits nicely under kitchen sink and I believe is the brand my old apartment company used to furnish their places. All I can say is that I received it in good shape and it was in the full range.  I haven't used it yet, so can't review honestly how well it worked.  Hopefully won't have to use! Compact in size, great to tuck away somewhere for that extra peace of mind!  Fits perfectly underneath our sink in the kitchen. Long lasting - expiration date far in the future! I lucky have not had a reason to deploy this device for its intended purpose! But it sits in my cabinet in the kitchen nicely.  And there's a small il piece of mind factor to it installed under the sink. Arrived perfectly charged.  I admit however that I have not tested this. I will leave a modified review if I have the unfortunate occasion to need it. My previous fire extinguisher was old and needed to be replaced and updated.  This extinguisher is near thestove, where fires are most likely and fits the bill perfectly. I have not had to use this fire extinguisher and hope never have to, so I can't say how well it works but it looks like its in great shape. The item was also shipped very fast! Luckily I haven't had to use this so I can't say for sure if it works or not. But this extinguisher appears to be of very good quality and I feel much better having it around! Another great product from Kidde, hopefully I won't have to ever use it. I do have a piece of mind purchasing a name brand fire extinguisher. Would definitely purchase again!   Good purchase and product. Will buy more. Need to make sure you shake it once a month so powder will not compress in bottom. This is the case on most fire extinguishers Fits in my kitchen cabinet away from the kids, heavy can for the smaller size that it is. Feels well constructed and seems like it's good quality. Arrived the next day! Everyone needs a fire extinguisher and this ABC Will put out electrical Cooking oil or grease how can you go wrong with that and at the price I will be purchasing more I found these fire extinguishers and purchased 3.  I needed them for the house.  Look great and was fully charged.  I hope if I ever need to use it it will work great. I haven't used it yet!  Thank God!!! But, the size of it is perfect for the kitchen.  The last one I had registered full for years.  This is an overall great purchase. Completely necessary for every home owner. I have one in the kitchen, in the bath, utility room, and in every vehicle.  I never want to look back and wish I'd had it. Will highly recommend Great fire extinguisher, just the right size for the home. Kidde followed through with great customer service during a recent recall. Very happy with this purchase. Haven't had to use my yet thankfully but I have one in each car just in case.  Nice and small for travel but big enough to put out a small to medium size car fire. I haven't had to use it yet. however just having it makes me feel safer for having it honestly for the price everyone should get one for a just in case situation.     I haven't had to use it yet, thank goodness. But it seems like it will work great. Light weight and fits under the sink nicely. ABC extinguisher. lightweight and easy to install. Hopefully won't have to use it! Seems like a perfect option for keeping around the house as a safety precaution Great compact fire extinguisher. simple and obvious to use (as bad as it may sound some people have NO CLUE how to use one). Easy to wall-mount. It came new,clean,and with alot of instructions as well.I have not used it yet BUT WHEN I DO..........ILL WRITE AN UPDATE HERE WITH THE RESULTS. I like the medium size. I can take it anywhere. It can fit in my kitchen pantry or be mounted on the wall. It's exactly what I was looking for. Not much to say.  I got it in good condition.  It was charged.  Looks easy to operate.  I hope it sits in the back area for many years to come. Bought this for my work truck. Nice. Compact.Not much to say. It's sitting in my toolbox.Hope to never have to use it. Every Christmas, I like to get my family things like fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and the like, for their safety and my peace of mind. Arrived in excellent condition. Thank goodness haven't had to use it, but am sure it will work fine if the need ever arises. Would recommend. Great for any home -- the wall-mount was a bonus as well. I taught my kids how to use these and they are the perfect size for anyone age 5+.    Great product. Just glad I did not have to use it. I have 3 more all around the house, garage and basement. Always good to have around I like the size of the extinguisher, good for stashing in cabinets or car trunk, wherever needed. Quality construction, good purchase. Fortunately I haven't used it but i mounted it in my fishing boat. The bracket holds it firmly in place while running in rough water. Have not had to use it, hopefully never have to. But the construction feels sturdy and am confident that this will perform if needed. Promptly delivered and exactly what I needed for my apartment. Hopefully I will never have to use it but it adds a sense of security. .... but I'm not sure cause I haven't had to put out a fire yet!  The delivery was on time and the product looks good, as advertised. I recommend that everyone have an extinguisher in their home.  I have never had to use one but just knowing it's there is comforting. I haven't had to use it thankfully and hopefully never have to but it looks good, mounts easily and seems to be of good workmanship. I haven't had to use it thankfully, but based on reviews from people who work in the fire fighting field I knew I couldn't go wrong! I bought this to go under my sick in my kitchen. It hasn't needed to be used yet, but is a great size and looks like superb quality
