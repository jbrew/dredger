   Purchased for my 1 yr old.  Immediately taken over by my 3yr old.  My 1 yr old loves it.  I was concerned about him being afraid but he wasn't.  He gets a kick out of the pop up.  The only issue is that he cannot push the jack in the box down his self so someone has to keep doing it for him repeatedly so after a few minutes I have to sneak it away from him and put it up. My kids are obsessed with this "grandpa" toy. I never would've guessed you could have so much fun with a Jack in the Box. This toy has clearly stood the test of time. My kids have re-named Jack to Lily, because "she's a girl clown". Lily-in-the-Box gets played with much more than I ever expected. Bought this for a grandson.  It works just like my own.  Meaning this is just like the antique type of Jack-In-The-Box.  It is the same music and see surprise followed by laughter.  This is a classic that is ageless. My twin 18 month old grandsons love this cute toy!  I like the fact it is not your typical toy in today's age.  Keeps them occupied and laughing, especially when an adult helps with turning the crank, and pushing the toy back inside. I loved this wholesome and charming toy and even more impressively, my 23 month-old nephew loved it, too.  He was thrilled every time the little Jack (clown) popped out of the box.  And after the first few tries, he was able to maneuver the lever on his own.  The colors are pretty and the little "Pop! Goes the Weasel" music is especially pretty.  All of us began humming and whistling the tune after hearing it.  As the chime really is lovely.  My nephew really enjoyed this toy and it kept his interest for a long period of time.  I very much recommend this toy. Little One quickly figured out the shortcut to open the lid by pushing the tiny spring-loaded clip back.  However, he still likes the jingle, so he makes us turn the crank to make the noise for him.  :-/  Still after several months, unit works as expected. Great classic toy to improve motor skills and teach patience to toddlers. My kid loves it. I do see the point that some reviewers made about reloading it being a bit difficult, but my kid has no issues. Brings a lot of fun and laughter every time :)Price seemed a bit higher than expected, but when compared to similar toys sold in stores this one has more quality and will last longer than others I believe.Pros:- Great classic toy. Makes kids use their motor skills and patience.- High quality material. Seem to be long-lasting.- Fun :)Cons:- None My 5 year old insisted he wanted a jack in the box for Christmas. I hated to spend 20 bucks on something so "old fashioned" he'd pay with once but it was a hit! My 1 year old loves it too.i guess you can't go wrong with the classics! Once my daughter understood you have to finish the song after he pops out to rescue the top door, it became her favorite.  She is 3 and LOVE this toy.  She is able to operate all aspects on her b own.  We only had to explain it to her twice. I bought this product for my wife, she loves the movie Bennie and June - which features the male star giving the female a jack in the box.. She loved that scene and I figured it would be a great gift for her.She loved it, and it went over very well. The product works as advertised - wind it up and Jack pops out.The case is metal, and sound is loud and clear and very easy to crank. The jack is easy to put back in the box, sometimes the lid doesn't "lock" though - just have to turn the crank a little to reset it.Added bonus is my pets (dog and cat) are terrified of it and know just when the thing is about to pop - to my wifes dismay this has been the most enjoyable part of this toy.     So nice to see a jack-in-the-box again!! I didn't even know they still existed except when my 4 year old grandson asked for one! My two young children loved it as well and are asking for one for their birthdays! When I was a little kid, I remember the joy of turning the crank and watching the clown pop up. Seems my grandchildren have the same happiness. It is really nice to see something old that is as fun (maybe not as addicting...) as the ipad. I am very savvy at researching & reading reviews on products before I spend my money.  I decided on this product because of its good reviews and I wasn't disappointed.  It is in a metal container, not plastic.  The colors are bright and fun.  It has a vintage look.  My 8-month old grandson loves it.  I read that some people complained because the song has to end before you can put the clown back in.  Big deal -  two seconds?  Not a problem.  I love this product & I love Amazon. My 15 month old just loves this Jack-in-the-box.  Other reviewers have had trouble with the latch but I have not had any trouble at all.  My son gets just as excited each time the clown jumps out as the first time.  The colors are great, the music is spot on and the materials are great quality. We were suprised when all our 5 yr old wanted for Christmas was a jack-in-the-box.  It's all she talked about the whole month of december.  We saved it for last when she was opening her presents and when she finally got to it she was ecstatic.  All her other presents ceased to exist and she walked around playing with her jack-in-the-box for a good portion of the morning.  It now holds a special place on her table in her room.  She played as though she was the jack-in-the-box herself for quite a while, we would have to make the "pop goes the weasel" music while she crouched down and then when we got to the right part she would jump straight up.  So not only is it a durable toy for my little girl, but it also engaged her imagination.  She has no problem pushing the clown back down into the box and resetting it either.  It is a simple, yet fun toy. This took me back to my childhood.  I purchased it for my two nephews age 2 1/2 and 14 months.  At first the older nephew did not like the "poping out" of the clown.  The younger one thought it was the funniest thing ever.  After awhile the older nephew learned to like the toy and now turns the handle so his younger brother and laugh when the clown pops out I bought this in July for my 1 year old. I was kind of worried that it would not stand the 1 year Olds abuse, but it has been a few months and she plays with it almost everyday like I did when I was a kid. Love this toy My granddaughter is kind of old for a jack-in-the-box but she received one when she was younger and it broke.  She missed it so much I had to get her another one.  Thank you for having the original one.  There are some newer versions out there, but I prefer the older original version.  She loves playing with it again! This toy was bought for my grandson who is 3 years old.  As he loves surprises, he was surprised as could be to find that after cranking the box and listening to some music, a clown popped out.  Although a simple toy, this simple toy gives a simple joy to young children.  It doesn't hurt to bring back yesterday with an old fashioned toy. This toy was intended to be for a 2 year olds bday party. My two TEENAGERS played w it endlessly while in the packingI had to hide it from them fearing they'd break out. So,that being said,it's a hit for ALL ages. Great nostalgic toy   Not too cheap, not too hard to work.Much better quality than the options I have seen in stores.  Plus, I love the classic feel to it.it should make it through two boys in my house.  I am very happy with this. Our 15 month old loves this(this was her Christmas present) but I would say that our 3 year olds love it even more! They have to help sissy with turning the handle but are surprised everytime the Jack in the Box pops out. It hasn't gotten old yet! What a great old time metal toy.  I bought two...one went to my grandson in Norway which Jack in the Box is not well known.It sure beats all these new electronic toys..............It has stood the test of time and will be around in another 60 years I am sure, to be enjoyed by another generation. In an attempt to recreate a childhood memory for my husband, I was happy to find the Schling Jack-in-the-Box.  The construction was far surperior to that of the beloved toy of the past, and I'd most definitely reccommend it to kids of all ages! This gift was purchased for our 18 month old great nephew, wanting him to experience to "old" style toys of yester years that are hard to find.  Henry loved it and got so tickled everytime the jack popped out of the box!! Great toy. I bought this for our church nursery but the teenagers seemed to enjoy it more than the toddlers.  It sad how a whole generation missed the classic "jack-in-the-box".  Fun to see em jump back when the clown pops up! :) If you're looking for a classic jack-in-the-box, like you might have had as a child, this is it! Children today seem to really like it too.  Makes a great gift as it's hard to find in stores. this toy is old... i used to have one of these as a child - and now my children requested it ( for Santa to bring)I enjoyed watching 4 year old and 1 year old cranking the lever and watching clown pop out I bought the Schylling Jack-in-The-Box for my two year old great grandson and we both love it!  He has much more expensive toys but he plays with the jack-in the-box more than the others.  Buying it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. It's a standard Jack in the Box.  Our baby loves it. It's getting hard to find toys without batteries and flashing lights and electronic sounds so many thanks!      This jack in the box is just like old time.  It works really well.  An older child or adult has to turn the handle to make the music and to make the jack pop out of the box. Well, it was a birthday wonder for my one-year-old grandson.  Giggles did ensue...over and over.  He giggled and so did most adults in the room.  It is a sturdy toy as well. Bought this for my son a few years ago. He absolutely loved it. Now my youngest son plays with it and it still works perfectly. Good product. A simple toy but a lot of fun. Schylling Jack-In-The-Box is well constructed.It scared the bejeepers out of my 2 1/2 year old old grandson, which means they haven't changed since I was a kid. I bought this for my grandson and he is scared of it. He likes to play with it but when Jack pops up it scares him. Waiting for him to get a little older to appreciate it. It works. And delights our toddler. It has only been used since Dec 25, but it seems solid enough to resist being pulled apart, and it probably won't break when dropped. My daughter asked for this toy for her 5th birthday and I can't believe how much fun she has with it. It's colorful and works great over and over and over and over... :) I use it in the church nursery to help distract children who are not happy about being left by their parents. It's an invaluable resource for entertaining the toddlers. My son was playing with a peter rabbit jack in the box at barnes & noble so I decided to get him and his brother one.  This is a very standard one and it works great. Our grandson was mesmerized at first but now he "cheats" and just flips the lever on top.  However the toy works as intended and my wife, (grandma), loves it.            I'm glad that it doesn't scare my niece, she actually loves it popping out of the box I was looking for the old fashion jack in the box and this fits the bill really well. It was what my niece asked for and she was happy to have it.  I'm glad I ordered it. son wanted this couldnt find one in stores so excited to find one made his n my xmas Loved this and so did the receiver!! Something a little fun to give from the past!! Bought it for my granddaughter she just loved it ,that's exactly what she wanted. No matter how old you are, this is hilarious. works very well. It is well made.

Arrived in excellent shape, my granddaughter liked it, so that makes me happy We had a great time with our 1 yr. old twins with this toy.  They loved it!!  What a great jack in the box.
