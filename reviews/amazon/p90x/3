This one is a frustrating one for me to rate a 3 star. I love the program itself. I have used this program for several years and it has been immensely helpful at getting me in shape and giving me a program from which to operate to stay in shape. I love the diet plan. I love Tony Horton's energy and passion as a trainer. I love everything about the content of the program itself.What I don't love is how much of the simple stuff they glossed over in their production of this program. The typo's in the printed materials abound. They seemed to have outsourced the production of the DVD's to a rather unreliable overseas company, because I have learned that it is pretty common for at least one if not several of the DVD's just flat not work.I also found out that if you order the program over Amazon the Beachbody company doesn't want to honor the warranty so they won't send you any replacement DVD's for the ones that don't end up working. Luckily a buddy of mine ordered this product at the same time I did, and the DVD's that didn't work in my kit were different ones that didn't work in his kit and we were able to make copies for each other so we both actually had the full set we paid for.They pretty heavily push their own very expensive protein bars and other nutritional supplements too when you can find others that really are just as good for a lot less money at local retailers.So in short, I would recommend the program, but I do hope they have improved their administration and production end of things in the sequel products. I am really enjoying the workouts but I was surprised by the fact that most of the workouts require dumbbells. It is not a problem for me because I have a full weight room in my basement. However, this would be a problem for people who were expecting to be working with bands ( this was my impression of P90X workouts). Also, many of the back workouts require you to have bands extended from the ceiling or a pull up bar. I have neither, but I do have a lat pull machine with many different bars and grips that I use as the substitution lifts. Additionally, I am not impressed with the cardio CD. I was ready to get moving and get into a good sweat, but the cd starts off with yoga exercises and then into some kenpo for over 35 minutes of the cardio workout ( the workouts are 58 minutes long including the warm up and cool down). The kit already comes with a yoga and kenpo workout so I was disappointed by the fact that I paid for this cd and did not get a cardio workout. I substituted this day instead with an elliptical workout. The positive side of this is that Tony Horton is great and the workouts are very intense and worth every minute. I am enjoying these types of workouts as I am totally bored with just going to the gym and lifting weights. I have done this my entire life. I find the P90X workouts rejuvenating. The AB ripper plus and the core synergistic workouts are  my favorite! If you stay with the scheduled routines you will see results and feel really good about your commitment to the program. It's like you become addicted because of the challenge. The base kit is best suited for experienced lifters who need to add muscle confusion to their workout routine or for those, like me, who have become bored with the gym scene. I find the workout to be good, he has them laid out in a good sequence, especially the weight training, yoga and plyometrics.  However, some of the moves like on the Kenpo are a little too choreographed and I find that I am wasting time trying to figure out how to do them rather than working out.  Also some of the people in certain dvd's have awful form...I am a personal trainer and I specialize in classical pilates, so I am all about form.  There also seems to be some "fluff", when you can just do a basic push up, or crunch he has you doing all this funky stuff, which is where I saw people struggling with form.The downfall to P90X is Tony, the instructor, ANNOYS the hell out of me.  One of those guys that has those cheesy one liners.....gets on my last good freaking nerve!!!Make sure if you order you get a book or PDF file with the lay out of the workout, otherwise you will get the 13 DVD's and not know what to do with them. For me, I found jumping right into P90X was not a good idea. Being out of shape and overweight (5'-9", 222 lbs and 55 yrs old), I found I actually might hurt myself by performing most of the activities on the video (I can't even do a single pull-up). My goal is to be able to perform these exercises, but all in good time. I decided to have this as my long range goal and start off simpler to get my weight down and get my body ready for strength training. I walk on my treadmill for 35 minutes (2 miles) and do some stretching three times a week. The other days, I walk on the treadmill for 20 minutes and perform basic dumbbell exercises covering all muscle groups. Along with a good diet, I have been steadily losing 2+ lbs a week. I am now down to 209 (my goal is my BMI index of 175 lbs). Hey, play it safe, don't hurt yourself, do exercises that you can succeed at now, take 6 or 8 months instead of 3 to get where you want to go and you can achieve such a goal. The workouts are good. I'm sure results would happen if you can stick with it. Supplements ARE required and are VERY pricey but you can find cheaper alternatives (though maybe not AS good) if you search online. The biggest problem I have is time. I can carve out some time to workout everyday but the average time required for these workouts is 75 minutes and some as long as 90. And the workouts are designed for 6 or 7 days a week. Twice a day for some programs. I just can't devote the time right now. I'm holding on to them just in case my life opens up later. But right now? There is no way. Also buy a cd/DVD book or extra cases. The cardboard sleeves these DVDs come in are damaging to the disk as you slide them in and out. I can't speak for you, but I can't drop this kind of bank on a product just to destroy it by means of its own packaging. Some of the exercises are kinda lame. It's a great product of you have dumbbells but bands are too tricky to try to substitute for many exercises. I think this is a good guide for people who don't have a clue as to how to get motivated. One of my dvd's doesn't work, but 11 of the 12 did. Interesting concept with the product but could have used more tweaking to make it even more user friendly. Trying to get through the first workout takes a lot of homework just to get out of the gate. I bought this DVD in February-GREAT WORKOUT.  No complaints about content.  HOWEVER, one of the DVDs did not work.  Beachbody will NOT cover this product if purchased from AMAZON.  They only offer customer support if purchased from them.  I have been trying for 5 months to get a new DVD and Have been told multiple times that I should have bought it from them.  They will not help you or even report the problem if you purchase it from AMAZOn. I liked it when I first got it, and went through it probably twice, but then I discovered free, ever changing HIIT workouts on YouTube. I do think the original P90X is waaaaaay better than either P90X2 - worthless, or P90X3 - ok I guess if that's the only exercise you're going to do at all, or if you're just a complete fitness beginner. The concept of getting small bits of exercise in, in limited chunks, is really good to fit in on days you can't schedule an hour, but even if that's the case there's a lot better ways of getting it than most of the workouts in this set.Tony Horton cannot teach yoga, and that pilates session in X3 is lame.If DVD drives still came in MacBooks I'd have kept P90X, for the upper body workouts mainly, but since I'm not about to buy a super drive, I gave all my exercise away on a Portland sharing network. Just began the workout so no results to share yet on that. The information included is very helpful. My only complaint is that all of the dvds are in Spanish. Granted there is an option to view each in English but it's annoying tof have to go in and select the option for each viewing of a workout. Wish I could have been given the English versions of the videos. The P90X workout is awesome.  I am just completing Block 1 (first 4 weeks) and I am following the program to the letter.  Unfortunately, one of the DVDs in the set called Yoga X and I haven't been able to do it because the DVD would not play.  I contacted customer service and after a delay, they sent me a Yoga DVD from some other exercise program NOT P90X.  I have been substituting the Yoga day with another Yoga DVD I already had and I supposedly have one on the way but the program is pretty expensive and I would think they would do quality checks on their DVDs to ensure they play.  In any event, my clothes are falling off me (only 20 more lbs to go) and I continue to wait for my P90X Yoga X DVD in the mail.  Hopefully this time they sent the right one.

I have been trying for 5 months to get a new DVD and Have been told multiple times that I should have bought it from them.  They will not help you or even report the problem if you purchase it from AMAZOn. I liked it when I first got it, and went through it probably twice, but then I discovered free, ever changing HIIT workouts on YouTube. I do think the original P90X is waaaaaay better than either P90X2 - worthless, or P90X3 - ok I guess if that's the only exercise you're going to do at all, or if you're just a complete fitness beginner. The concept of getting small bits of exercise in, in limited chunks, is really good to fit in on days you can't schedule an hour, but even if that's the case there's a lot better ways of getting it than most of the workouts in this set.Tony Horton cannot teach yoga, and that pilates session in X3 is lame.If DVD drives still came in MacBooks I'd have kept P90X, for the upper body workouts mainly, but since I'm not about to buy a super drive, I gave all my exercise away on a Portland sharing network. Just began the workout so no results to share yet on that. The information included is very helpful. My only complaint is that all of the dvds are in Spanish. Granted there is an option to view each in English but it's annoying tof have to go in and select the option for each viewing of a workout. Wish I could have been given the English versions of the videos. The P90X workout is awesome.  I am just completing Block 1 (first 4 weeks) and I am following the program to the letter.  Unfortunately, one of the DVDs in the set called Yoga X and I haven't been able to do it because the DVD would not play.  I contacted customer service and after a delay, they sent me a Yoga DVD from some other exercise program NOT P90X.  I have been substituting the Yoga day with another Yoga DVD I already had and I supposedly have one on the way but the program is pretty expensive and I would think they would do quality checks on their DVDs to ensure they play.  In any event, my clothes are falling off me (only 20 more lbs to go) and I continue to wait for my P90X Yoga X DVD in the mail.  Hopefully this time they sent the right one.  This one is a frustrating one for me to rate a 3 star. I love the program itself. I have used this program for several years and it has been immensely helpful at getting me in shape and giving me a program from which to operate to stay in shape. I love the diet plan. I love Tony Horton's energy and passion as a trainer. I love everything about the content of the program itself.What I don't love is how much of the simple stuff they glossed over in their production of this program. The typo's in the printed materials abound. They seemed to have outsourced the production of the DVD's to a rather unreliable overseas company, because I have learned that it is pretty common for at least one if not several of the DVD's just flat not work.I also found out that if you order the program over Amazon the Beachbody company doesn't want to honor the warranty so they won't send you any replacement DVD's for the ones that don't end up working. Luckily a buddy of mine ordered this product at the same time I did, and the DVD's that didn't work in my kit were different ones that didn't work in his kit and we were able to make copies for each other so we both actually had the full set we paid for.They pretty heavily push their own very expensive protein bars and other nutritional supplements too when you can find others that really are just as good for a lot less money at local retailers.So in short, I would recommend the program, but I do hope they have improved their administration and production end of things in the sequel products. I am really enjoying the workouts but I was surprised by the fact that most of the workouts require dumbbells. It is not a problem for me because I have a full weight room in my basement. However, this would be a problem for people who were expecting to be working with bands ( this was my impression of P90X workouts). Also, many of the back workouts require you to have bands extended from the ceiling or a pull up bar. I have neither, but I do have a lat pull machine with many different bars and grips that I use as the substitution lifts. Additionally, I am not impressed with the cardio CD. I was ready to get moving and get into a good sweat, but the cd starts off with yoga exercises and then into some kenpo for over 35 minutes of the cardio workout ( the workouts are 58 minutes long including the warm up and cool down). The kit already comes with a yoga and kenpo workout so I was disappointed by the fact that I paid for this cd and did not get a cardio workout. I substituted this day instead with an elliptical workout. The positive side of this is that Tony Horton is great and the workouts are very intense and worth every minute. I am enjoying these types of workouts as I am totally bored with just going to the gym and lifting weights. I have done this my entire life. I find the P90X workouts rejuvenating. The AB ripper plus and the core synergistic workouts are  my favorite! If you stay with the scheduled routines you will see results and feel really good about your commitment to the program. It's like you become addicted because of the challenge. The base kit is best suited for experienced lifters who need to add muscle confusion to their workout routine or for those, like me, who have become bored with the gym scene. I find the workout to be good, he has them laid out in a good sequence, especially the weight training, yoga and plyometrics.  However, some of the moves like on the Kenpo are a little too choreographed and I find that I am wasting time trying to figure out how to do them rather than working out.  Also some of the people in certain dvd's have awful form...I am a personal trainer and I specialize in classical pilates, so I am all about form.  There also seems to be some "fluff", when you can just do a basic push up, or crunch he has you doing all this funky stuff, which is where I saw people struggling with form.The downfall to P90X is Tony, the instructor, ANNOYS the hell out of me.  One of those guys that has those cheesy one liners.....gets on my last good freaking nerve!!!Make sure if you order you get a book or PDF file with the lay out of the workout, otherwise you will get the 13 DVD's and not know what to do with them. For me, I found jumping right into P90X was not a good idea. Being out of shape and overweight (5'-9", 222 lbs and 55 yrs old), I found I actually might hurt myself by performing most of the activities on the video (I can't even do a single pull-up). My goal is to be able to perform these exercises, but all in good time. I decided to have this as my long range goal and start off simpler to get my weight down and get my body ready for strength training. I walk on my treadmill for 35 minutes (2 miles) and do some stretching three times a week. The other days, I walk on the treadmill for 20 minutes and perform basic dumbbell exercises covering all muscle groups. Along with a good diet, I have been steadily losing 2+ lbs a week. I am now down to 209 (my goal is my BMI index of 175 lbs). Hey, play it safe, don't hurt yourself, do exercises that you can succeed at now, take 6 or 8 months instead of 3 to get where you want to go and you can achieve such a goal. The workouts are good. I'm sure results would happen if you can stick with it. Supplements ARE required and are VERY pricey but you can find cheaper alternatives (though maybe not AS good) if you search online. The biggest problem I have is time. I can carve out some time to workout everyday but the average time required for these workouts is 75 minutes and some as long as 90. And the workouts are designed for 6 or 7 days a week. Twice a day for some programs. I just can't devote the time right now. I'm holding on to them just in case my life opens up later. But right now? There is no way. Also buy a cd/DVD book or extra cases. The cardboard sleeves these DVDs come in are damaging to the disk as you slide them in and out. I can't speak for you, but I can't drop this kind of bank on a product just to destroy it by means of its own packaging. Some of the exercises are kinda lame. It's a great product of you have dumbbells but bands are too tricky to try to substitute for many exercises. I think this is a good guide for people who don't have a clue as to how to get motivated. One of my dvd's doesn't work, but 11 of the 12 did. Interesting concept with the product but could have used more tweaking to make it even more user friendly.

Being out of shape and overweight (5'-9", 222 lbs and 55 yrs old), I found I actually might hurt myself by performing most of the activities on the video (I can't even do a single pull-up). My goal is to be able to perform these exercises, but all in good time. I decided to have this as my long range goal and start off simpler to get my weight down and get my body ready for strength training. I walk on my treadmill for 35 minutes (2 miles) and do some stretching three times a week. The other days, I walk on the treadmill for 20 minutes and perform basic dumbbell exercises covering all muscle groups. Along with a good diet, I have been steadily losing 2+ lbs a week. I am now down to 209 (my goal is my BMI index of 175 lbs). Hey, play it safe, don't hurt yourself, do exercises that you can succeed at now, take 6 or 8 months instead of 3 to get where you want to go and you can achieve such a goal. The workouts are good. I'm sure results would happen if you can stick with it. Supplements ARE required and are VERY pricey but you can find cheaper alternatives (though maybe not AS good) if you search online. The biggest problem I have is time. I can carve out some time to workout everyday but the average time required for these workouts is 75 minutes and some as long as 90. And the workouts are designed for 6 or 7 days a week. Twice a day for some programs. I just can't devote the time right now. I'm holding on to them just in case my life opens up later. But right now? There is no way. Also buy a cd/DVD book or extra cases. The cardboard sleeves these DVDs come in are damaging to the disk as you slide them in and out. I can't speak for you, but I can't drop this kind of bank on a product just to destroy it by means of its own packaging. Some of the exercises are kinda lame. It's a great product of you have dumbbells but bands are too tricky to try to substitute for many exercises. I think this is a good guide for people who don't have a clue as to how to get motivated. One of my dvd's doesn't work, but 11 of the 12 did. Interesting concept with the product but could have used more tweaking to make it even more user friendly. Trying to get through the first workout takes a lot of homework just to get out of the gate. I bought this DVD in February-GREAT WORKOUT.  No complaints about content.  HOWEVER, one of the DVDs did not work.  Beachbody will NOT cover this product if purchased from AMAZON.  They only offer customer support if purchased from them.  I have been trying for 5 months to get a new DVD and Have been told multiple times that I should have bought it from them.  They will not help you or even report the problem if you purchase it from AMAZOn. I liked it when I first got it, and went through it probably twice, but then I discovered free, ever changing HIIT workouts on YouTube. I do think the original P90X is waaaaaay better than either P90X2 - worthless, or P90X3 - ok I guess if that's the only exercise you're going to do at all, or if you're just a complete fitness beginner. The concept of getting small bits of exercise in, in limited chunks, is really good to fit in on days you can't schedule an hour, but even if that's the case there's a lot better ways of getting it than most of the workouts in this set.Tony Horton cannot teach yoga, and that pilates session in X3 is lame.If DVD drives still came in MacBooks I'd have kept P90X, for the upper body workouts mainly, but since I'm not about to buy a super drive, I gave all my exercise away on a Portland sharing network. Just began the workout so no results to share yet on that. The information included is very helpful. My only complaint is that all of the dvds are in Spanish. Granted there is an option to view each in English but it's annoying tof have to go in and select the option for each viewing of a workout. Wish I could have been given the English versions of the videos. The P90X workout is awesome.  I am just completing Block 1 (first 4 weeks) and I am following the program to the letter.  Unfortunately, one of the DVDs in the set called Yoga X and I haven't been able to do it because the DVD would not play.  I contacted customer service and after a delay, they sent me a Yoga DVD from some other exercise program NOT P90X.  I have been substituting the Yoga day with another Yoga DVD I already had and I supposedly have one on the way but the program is pretty expensive and I would think they would do quality checks on their DVDs to ensure they play.  In any event, my clothes are falling off me (only 20 more lbs to go) and I continue to wait for my P90X Yoga X DVD in the mail.  Hopefully this time they sent the right one.  This one is a frustrating one for me to rate a 3 star. I love the program itself. I have used this program for several years and it has been immensely helpful at getting me in shape and giving me a program from which to operate to stay in shape. I love the diet plan. I love Tony Horton's energy and passion as a trainer. I love everything about the content of the program itself.What I don't love is how much of the simple stuff they glossed over in their production of this program. The typo's in the printed materials abound. They seemed to have outsourced the production of the DVD's to a rather unreliable overseas company, because I have learned that it is pretty common for at least one if not several of the DVD's just flat not work.I also found out that if you order the program over Amazon the Beachbody company doesn't want to honor the warranty so they won't send you any replacement DVD's for the ones that don't end up working. Luckily a buddy of mine ordered this product at the same time I did, and the DVD's that didn't work in my kit were different ones that didn't work in his kit and we were able to make copies for each other so we both actually had the full set we paid for.They pretty heavily push their own very expensive protein bars and other nutritional supplements too when you can find others that really are just as good for a lot less money at local retailers.So in short, I would recommend the program, but I do hope they have improved their administration and production end of things in the sequel products. I am really enjoying the workouts but I was surprised by the fact that most of the workouts require dumbbells. It is not a problem for me because I have a full weight room in my basement. However, this would be a problem for people who were expecting to be working with bands ( this was my impression of P90X workouts). Also, many of the back workouts require you to have bands extended from the ceiling or a pull up bar. I have neither, but I do have a lat pull machine with many different bars and grips that I use as the substitution lifts. Additionally, I am not impressed with the cardio CD. I was ready to get moving and get into a good sweat, but the cd starts off with yoga exercises and then into some kenpo for over 35 minutes of the cardio workout ( the workouts are 58 minutes long including the warm up and cool down). The kit already comes with a yoga and kenpo workout so I was disappointed by the fact that I paid for this cd and did not get a cardio workout. I substituted this day instead with an elliptical workout. The positive side of this is that Tony Horton is great and the workouts are very intense and worth every minute. I am enjoying these types of workouts as I am totally bored with just going to the gym and lifting weights. I have done this my entire life. I find the P90X workouts rejuvenating. The AB ripper plus and the core synergistic workouts are  my favorite! If you stay with the scheduled routines you will see results and feel really good about your commitment to the program. It's like you become addicted because of the challenge. The base kit is best suited for experienced lifters who need to add muscle confusion to their workout routine or for those, like me, who have become bored with the gym scene. I find the workout to be good, he has them laid out in a good sequence, especially the weight training, yoga and plyometrics.  However, some of the moves like on the Kenpo are a little too choreographed and I find that I am wasting time trying to figure out how to do them rather than working out.  Also some of the people in certain dvd's have awful form...I am a personal trainer and I specialize in classical pilates, so I am all about form.  There also seems to be some "fluff", when you can just do a basic push up, or crunch he has you doing all this funky stuff, which is where I saw people struggling with form.The downfall to P90X is Tony, the instructor, ANNOYS the hell out of me.

I am really enjoying the workouts but I was surprised by the fact that most of the workouts require dumbbells. It is not a problem for me because I have a full weight room in my basement. However, this would be a problem for people who were expecting to be working with bands ( this was my impression of P90X workouts). Also, many of the back workouts require you to have bands extended from the ceiling or a pull up bar. I have neither, but I do have a lat pull machine with many different bars and grips that I use as the substitution lifts. Additionally, I am not impressed with the cardio CD. I was ready to get moving and get into a good sweat, but the cd starts off with yoga exercises and then into some kenpo for over 35 minutes of the cardio workout ( the workouts are 58 minutes long including the warm up and cool down). The kit already comes with a yoga and kenpo workout so I was disappointed by the fact that I paid for this cd and did not get a cardio workout. I substituted this day instead with an elliptical workout. The positive side of this is that Tony Horton is great and the workouts are very intense and worth every minute. I am enjoying these types of workouts as I am totally bored with just going to the gym and lifting weights. I have done this my entire life. I find the P90X workouts rejuvenating. The AB ripper plus and the core synergistic workouts are  my favorite! If you stay with the scheduled routines you will see results and feel really good about your commitment to the program. It's like you become addicted because of the challenge. The base kit is best suited for experienced lifters who need to add muscle confusion to their workout routine or for those, like me, who have become bored with the gym scene. I find the workout to be good, he has them laid out in a good sequence, especially the weight training, yoga and plyometrics.  However, some of the moves like on the Kenpo are a little too choreographed and I find that I am wasting time trying to figure out how to do them rather than working out.  Also some of the people in certain dvd's have awful form...I am a personal trainer and I specialize in classical pilates, so I am all about form.  There also seems to be some "fluff", when you can just do a basic push up, or crunch he has you doing all this funky stuff, which is where I saw people struggling with form.The downfall to P90X is Tony, the instructor, ANNOYS the hell out of me.  One of those guys that has those cheesy one liners.....gets on my last good freaking nerve!!!Make sure if you order you get a book or PDF file with the lay out of the workout, otherwise you will get the 13 DVD's and not know what to do with them. For me, I found jumping right into P90X was not a good idea. Being out of shape and overweight (5'-9", 222 lbs and 55 yrs old), I found I actually might hurt myself by performing most of the activities on the video (I can't even do a single pull-up). My goal is to be able to perform these exercises, but all in good time. I decided to have this as my long range goal and start off simpler to get my weight down and get my body ready for strength training. I walk on my treadmill for 35 minutes (2 miles) and do some stretching three times a week. The other days, I walk on the treadmill for 20 minutes and perform basic dumbbell exercises covering all muscle groups. Along with a good diet, I have been steadily losing 2+ lbs a week. I am now down to 209 (my goal is my BMI index of 175 lbs). Hey, play it safe, don't hurt yourself, do exercises that you can succeed at now, take 6 or 8 months instead of 3 to get where you want to go and you can achieve such a goal. The workouts are good. I'm sure results would happen if you can stick with it. Supplements ARE required and are VERY pricey but you can find cheaper alternatives (though maybe not AS good) if you search online. The biggest problem I have is time. I can carve out some time to workout everyday but the average time required for these workouts is 75 minutes and some as long as 90. And the workouts are designed for 6 or 7 days a week. Twice a day for some programs. I just can't devote the time right now. I'm holding on to them just in case my life opens up later. But right now? There is no way. Also buy a cd/DVD book or extra cases. The cardboard sleeves these DVDs come in are damaging to the disk as you slide them in and out. I can't speak for you, but I can't drop this kind of bank on a product just to destroy it by means of its own packaging. Some of the exercises are kinda lame. It's a great product of you have dumbbells but bands are too tricky to try to substitute for many exercises. I think this is a good guide for people who don't have a clue as to how to get motivated. One of my dvd's doesn't work, but 11 of the 12 did. Interesting concept with the product but could have used more tweaking to make it even more user friendly. Trying to get through the first workout takes a lot of homework just to get out of the gate. I bought this DVD in February-GREAT WORKOUT.  No complaints about content.  HOWEVER, one of the DVDs did not work.  Beachbody will NOT cover this product if purchased from AMAZON.  They only offer customer support if purchased from them.  I have been trying for 5 months to get a new DVD and Have been told multiple times that I should have bought it from them.  They will not help you or even report the problem if you purchase it from AMAZOn. I liked it when I first got it, and went through it probably twice, but then I discovered free, ever changing HIIT workouts on YouTube. I do think the original P90X is waaaaaay better than either P90X2 - worthless, or P90X3 - ok I guess if that's the only exercise you're going to do at all, or if you're just a complete fitness beginner. The concept of getting small bits of exercise in, in limited chunks, is really good to fit in on days you can't schedule an hour, but even if that's the case there's a lot better ways of getting it than most of the workouts in this set.Tony Horton cannot teach yoga, and that pilates session in X3 is lame.If DVD drives still came in MacBooks I'd have kept P90X, for the upper body workouts mainly, but since I'm not about to buy a super drive, I gave all my exercise away on a Portland sharing network. Just began the workout so no results to share yet on that. The information included is very helpful. My only complaint is that all of the dvds are in Spanish. Granted there is an option to view each in English but it's annoying tof have to go in and select the option for each viewing of a workout. Wish I could have been given the English versions of the videos. The P90X workout is awesome.  I am just completing Block 1 (first 4 weeks) and I am following the program to the letter.  Unfortunately, one of the DVDs in the set called Yoga X and I haven't been able to do it because the DVD would not play.  I contacted customer service and after a delay, they sent me a Yoga DVD from some other exercise program NOT P90X.  I have been substituting the Yoga day with another Yoga DVD I already had and I supposedly have one on the way but the program is pretty expensive and I would think they would do quality checks on their DVDs to ensure they play.  In any event, my clothes are falling off me (only 20 more lbs to go) and I continue to wait for my P90X Yoga X DVD in the mail.  Hopefully this time they sent the right one.  This one is a frustrating one for me to rate a 3 star. I love the program itself. I have used this program for several years and it has been immensely helpful at getting me in shape and giving me a program from which to operate to stay in shape. I love the diet plan. I love Tony Horton's energy and passion as a trainer. I love everything about the content of the program itself.What I don't love is how much of the simple stuff they glossed over in their production of this program. The typo's in the printed materials abound. They seemed to have outsourced the production of the DVD's to a rather unreliable overseas company, because I have learned that it is pretty common for at least one if not several of the DVD's just flat not work.I also found out that if you order the program over Amazon the Beachbody company doesn't want to honor the warranty so they won't send you any replacement DVD's for the ones that don't end up working.

I do think the original P90X is waaaaaay better than either P90X2 - worthless, or P90X3 - ok I guess if that's the only exercise you're going to do at all, or if you're just a complete fitness beginner. The concept of getting small bits of exercise in, in limited chunks, is really good to fit in on days you can't schedule an hour, but even if that's the case there's a lot better ways of getting it than most of the workouts in this set.Tony Horton cannot teach yoga, and that pilates session in X3 is lame.If DVD drives still came in MacBooks I'd have kept P90X, for the upper body workouts mainly, but since I'm not about to buy a super drive, I gave all my exercise away on a Portland sharing network.

Wish I could have been given the English versions of the videos. The P90X workout is awesome.  I am just completing Block 1 (first 4 weeks) and I am following the program to the letter.  Unfortunately, one of the DVDs in the set called Yoga X and I haven't been able to do it because the DVD would not play.  I contacted customer service and after a delay, they sent me a Yoga DVD from some other exercise program NOT P90X.  I have been substituting the Yoga day with another Yoga DVD I already had and I supposedly have one on the way but the program is pretty expensive and I would think they would do quality checks on their DVDs to ensure they play.  In any event, my clothes are falling off me (only 20 more lbs to go) and I continue to wait for my P90X Yoga X DVD in the mail.  Hopefully this time they sent the right one.  This one is a frustrating one for me to rate a 3 star. I love the program itself. I have used this program for several years and it has been immensely helpful at getting me in shape and giving me a program from which to operate to stay in shape. I love the diet plan. I love Tony Horton's energy and passion as a trainer. I love everything about the content of the program itself.What I don't love is how much of the simple stuff they glossed over in their production of this program. The typo's in the printed materials abound. They seemed to have outsourced the production of the DVD's to a rather unreliable overseas company, because I have learned that it is pretty common for at least one if not several of the DVD's just flat not work.I also found out that if you order the program over Amazon the Beachbody company doesn't want to honor the warranty so they won't send you any replacement DVD's for the ones that don't end up working. Luckily a buddy of mine ordered this product at the same time I did, and the DVD's that didn't work in my kit were different ones that didn't work in his kit and we were able to make copies for each other so we both actually had the full set we paid for.They pretty heavily push their own very expensive protein bars and other nutritional supplements too when you can find others that really are just as good for a lot less money at local retailers.So in short, I would recommend the program, but I do hope they have improved their administration and production end of things in the sequel products. I am really enjoying the workouts but I was surprised by the fact that most of the workouts require dumbbells. It is not a problem for me because I have a full weight room in my basement. However, this would be a problem for people who were expecting to be working with bands ( this was my impression of P90X workouts). Also, many of the back workouts require you to have bands extended from the ceiling or a pull up bar. I have neither, but I do have a lat pull machine with many different bars and grips that I use as the substitution lifts. Additionally, I am not impressed with the cardio CD. I was ready to get moving and get into a good sweat, but the cd starts off with yoga exercises and then into some kenpo for over 35 minutes of the cardio workout ( the workouts are 58 minutes long including the warm up and cool down). The kit already comes with a yoga and kenpo workout so I was disappointed by the fact that I paid for this cd and did not get a cardio workout. I substituted this day instead with an elliptical workout. The positive side of this is that Tony Horton is great and the workouts are very intense and worth every minute. I am enjoying these types of workouts as I am totally bored with just going to the gym and lifting weights. I have done this my entire life. I find the P90X workouts rejuvenating. The AB ripper plus and the core synergistic workouts are  my favorite! If you stay with the scheduled routines you will see results and feel really good about your commitment to the program. It's like you become addicted because of the challenge. The base kit is best suited for experienced lifters who need to add muscle confusion to their workout routine or for those, like me, who have become bored with the gym scene. I find the workout to be good, he has them laid out in a good sequence, especially the weight training, yoga and plyometrics.  However, some of the moves like on the Kenpo are a little too choreographed and I find that I am wasting time trying to figure out how to do them rather than working out.  Also some of the people in certain dvd's have awful form...I am a personal trainer and I specialize in classical pilates, so I am all about form.  There also seems to be some "fluff", when you can just do a basic push up, or crunch he has you doing all this funky stuff, which is where I saw people struggling with form.The downfall to P90X is Tony, the instructor, ANNOYS the hell out of me.  One of those guys that has those cheesy one liners.....gets on my last good freaking nerve!!!Make sure if you order you get a book or PDF file with the lay out of the workout, otherwise you will get the 13 DVD's and not know what to do with them. For me, I found jumping right into P90X was not a good idea. Being out of shape and overweight (5'-9", 222 lbs and 55 yrs old), I found I actually might hurt myself by performing most of the activities on the video (I can't even do a single pull-up). My goal is to be able to perform these exercises, but all in good time. I decided to have this as my long range goal and start off simpler to get my weight down and get my body ready for strength training. I walk on my treadmill for 35 minutes (2 miles) and do some stretching three times a week. The other days, I walk on the treadmill for 20 minutes and perform basic dumbbell exercises covering all muscle groups. Along with a good diet, I have been steadily losing 2+ lbs a week. I am now down to 209 (my goal is my BMI index of 175 lbs). Hey, play it safe, don't hurt yourself, do exercises that you can succeed at now, take 6 or 8 months instead of 3 to get where you want to go and you can achieve such a goal. The workouts are good. I'm sure results would happen if you can stick with it. Supplements ARE required and are VERY pricey but you can find cheaper alternatives (though maybe not AS good) if you search online. The biggest problem I have is time. I can carve out some time to workout everyday but the average time required for these workouts is 75 minutes and some as long as 90. And the workouts are designed for 6 or 7 days a week. Twice a day for some programs. I just can't devote the time right now. I'm holding on to them just in case my life opens up later. But right now? There is no way. Also buy a cd/DVD book or extra cases. The cardboard sleeves these DVDs come in are damaging to the disk as you slide them in and out. I can't speak for you, but I can't drop this kind of bank on a product just to destroy it by means of its own packaging. Some of the exercises are kinda lame. It's a great product of you have dumbbells but bands are too tricky to try to substitute for many exercises. I think this is a good guide for people who don't have a clue as to how to get motivated. One of my dvd's doesn't work, but 11 of the 12 did. Interesting concept with the product but could have used more tweaking to make it even more user friendly.

I walk on my treadmill for 35 minutes (2 miles) and do some stretching three times a week. The other days, I walk on the treadmill for 20 minutes and perform basic dumbbell exercises covering all muscle groups. Along with a good diet, I have been steadily losing 2+ lbs a week. I am now down to 209 (my goal is my BMI index of 175 lbs). Hey, play it safe, don't hurt yourself, do exercises that you can succeed at now, take 6 or 8 months instead of 3 to get where you want to go and you can achieve such a goal. The workouts are good. I'm sure results would happen if you can stick with it. Supplements ARE required and are VERY pricey but you can find cheaper alternatives (though maybe not AS good) if you search online. The biggest problem I have is time. I can carve out some time to workout everyday but the average time required for these workouts is 75 minutes and some as long as 90. And the workouts are designed for 6 or 7 days a week. Twice a day for some programs. I just can't devote the time right now. I'm holding on to them just in case my life opens up later. But right now? There is no way. Also buy a cd/DVD book or extra cases. The cardboard sleeves these DVDs come in are damaging to the disk as you slide them in and out. I can't speak for you, but I can't drop this kind of bank on a product just to destroy it by means of its own packaging. Some of the exercises are kinda lame. It's a great product of you have dumbbells but bands are too tricky to try to substitute for many exercises. I think this is a good guide for people who don't have a clue as to how to get motivated. One of my dvd's doesn't work, but 11 of the 12 did. Interesting concept with the product but could have used more tweaking to make it even more user friendly. Trying to get through the first workout takes a lot of homework just to get out of the gate. I bought this DVD in February-GREAT WORKOUT.  No complaints about content.  HOWEVER, one of the DVDs did not work.  Beachbody will NOT cover this product if purchased from AMAZON.  They only offer customer support if purchased from them.  I have been trying for 5 months to get a new DVD and Have been told multiple times that I should have bought it from them.  They will not help you or even report the problem if you purchase it from AMAZOn. I liked it when I first got it, and went through it probably twice, but then I discovered free, ever changing HIIT workouts on YouTube. I do think the original P90X is waaaaaay better than either P90X2 - worthless, or P90X3 - ok I guess if that's the only exercise you're going to do at all, or if you're just a complete fitness beginner. The concept of getting small bits of exercise in, in limited chunks, is really good to fit in on days you can't schedule an hour, but even if that's the case there's a lot better ways of getting it than most of the workouts in this set.Tony Horton cannot teach yoga, and that pilates session in X3 is lame.If DVD drives still came in MacBooks I'd have kept P90X, for the upper body workouts mainly, but since I'm not about to buy a super drive, I gave all my exercise away on a Portland sharing network. Just began the workout so no results to share yet on that. The information included is very helpful. My only complaint is that all of the dvds are in Spanish. Granted there is an option to view each in English but it's annoying tof have to go in and select the option for each viewing of a workout. Wish I could have been given the English versions of the videos. The P90X workout is awesome.  I am just completing Block 1 (first 4 weeks) and I am following the program to the letter.  Unfortunately, one of the DVDs in the set called Yoga X and I haven't been able to do it because the DVD would not play.  I contacted customer service and after a delay, they sent me a Yoga DVD from some other exercise program NOT P90X.  I have been substituting the Yoga day with another Yoga DVD I already had and I supposedly have one on the way but the program is pretty expensive and I would think they would do quality checks on their DVDs to ensure they play.  In any event, my clothes are falling off me (only 20 more lbs to go) and I continue to wait for my P90X Yoga X DVD in the mail.  Hopefully this time they sent the right one.  This one is a frustrating one for me to rate a 3 star. I love the program itself. I have used this program for several years and it has been immensely helpful at getting me in shape and giving me a program from which to operate to stay in shape. I love the diet plan. I love Tony Horton's energy and passion as a trainer. I love everything about the content of the program itself.What I don't love is how much of the simple stuff they glossed over in their production of this program. The typo's in the printed materials abound. They seemed to have outsourced the production of the DVD's to a rather unreliable overseas company, because I have learned that it is pretty common for at least one if not several of the DVD's just flat not work.I also found out that if you order the program over Amazon the Beachbody company doesn't want to honor the warranty so they won't send you any replacement DVD's for the ones that don't end up working. Luckily a buddy of mine ordered this product at the same time I did, and the DVD's that didn't work in my kit were different ones that didn't work in his kit and we were able to make copies for each other so we both actually had the full set we paid for.They pretty heavily push their own very expensive protein bars and other nutritional supplements too when you can find others that really are just as good for a lot less money at local retailers.So in short, I would recommend the program, but I do hope they have improved their administration and production end of things in the sequel products. I am really enjoying the workouts but I was surprised by the fact that most of the workouts require dumbbells. It is not a problem for me because I have a full weight room in my basement. However, this would be a problem for people who were expecting to be working with bands ( this was my impression of P90X workouts). Also, many of the back workouts require you to have bands extended from the ceiling or a pull up bar. I have neither, but I do have a lat pull machine with many different bars and grips that I use as the substitution lifts. Additionally, I am not impressed with the cardio CD. I was ready to get moving and get into a good sweat, but the cd starts off with yoga exercises and then into some kenpo for over 35 minutes of the cardio workout ( the workouts are 58 minutes long including the warm up and cool down). The kit already comes with a yoga and kenpo workout so I was disappointed by the fact that I paid for this cd and did not get a cardio workout. I substituted this day instead with an elliptical workout. The positive side of this is that Tony Horton is great and the workouts are very intense and worth every minute. I am enjoying these types of workouts as I am totally bored with just going to the gym and lifting weights. I have done this my entire life. I find the P90X workouts rejuvenating. The AB ripper plus and the core synergistic workouts are  my favorite! If you stay with the scheduled routines you will see results and feel really good about your commitment to the program. It's like you become addicted because of the challenge. The base kit is best suited for experienced lifters who need to add muscle confusion to their workout routine or for those, like me, who have become bored with the gym scene. I find the workout to be good, he has them laid out in a good sequence, especially the weight training, yoga and plyometrics.  However, some of the moves like on the Kenpo are a little too choreographed and I find that I am wasting time trying to figure out how to do them rather than working out.  Also some of the people in certain dvd's have awful form...I am a personal trainer and I specialize in classical pilates, so I am all about form.  There also seems to be some "fluff", when you can just do a basic push up, or crunch he has you doing all this funky stuff, which is where I saw people struggling with form.The downfall to P90X is Tony, the instructor, ANNOYS the hell out of me.  One of those guys that has those cheesy one liners.....gets on my last good freaking nerve!!!Make sure if you order you get a book or PDF file with the lay out of the workout, otherwise you will get the 13 DVD's and not know what to do with them. For me, I found jumping right into P90X was not a good idea. Being out of shape and overweight (5'-9", 222 lbs and 55 yrs old), I found I actually might hurt myself by performing most of the activities on the video (I can't even do a single pull-up). My goal is to be able to perform these exercises, but all in good time. I decided to have this as my long range goal and start off simpler to get my weight down and get my body ready for strength training.
