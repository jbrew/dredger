A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.  I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se. As I see it, the main purpose is to lower your overall body fat percentage so that you get a leaner look, as demonstrated by the numerous before and after pictures available on the Internet.So, what's the secret to lowering body fat percentage in general?  It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).  I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working.

I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.  I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se. As I see it, the main purpose is to lower your overall body fat percentage so that you get a leaner look, as demonstrated by the numerous before and after pictures available on the Internet.So, what's the secret to lowering body fat percentage in general?  It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).

It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).  I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.  I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se.

Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.  I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se. As I see it, the main purpose is to lower your overall body fat percentage so that you get a leaner look, as demonstrated by the numerous before and after pictures available on the Internet.So, what's the secret to lowering body fat percentage in general?  It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).  I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless.

Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing.

With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).  I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.  I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se. As I see it, the main purpose is to lower your overall body fat percentage so that you get a leaner look, as demonstrated by the numerous before and after pictures available on the Internet.So, what's the secret to lowering body fat percentage in general?  It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.

For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se. As I see it, the main purpose is to lower your overall body fat percentage so that you get a leaner look, as demonstrated by the numerous before and after pictures available on the Internet.So, what's the secret to lowering body fat percentage in general?  It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).  I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.  I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering).

Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.  I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se. As I see it, the main purpose is to lower your overall body fat percentage so that you get a leaner look, as demonstrated by the numerous before and after pictures available on the Internet.So, what's the secret to lowering body fat percentage in general?  It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).  I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).

While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).  I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.  I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se. As I see it, the main purpose is to lower your overall body fat percentage so that you get a leaner look, as demonstrated by the numerous before and after pictures available on the Internet.So, what's the secret to lowering body fat percentage in general?  It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program.

I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se. As I see it, the main purpose is to lower your overall body fat percentage so that you get a leaner look, as demonstrated by the numerous before and after pictures available on the Internet.So, what's the secret to lowering body fat percentage in general?  It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).  I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.  I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time.

That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.  I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se. As I see it, the main purpose is to lower your overall body fat percentage so that you get a leaner look, as demonstrated by the numerous before and after pictures available on the Internet.So, what's the secret to lowering body fat percentage in general?  It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).  I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.

If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).  I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.  I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se. As I see it, the main purpose is to lower your overall body fat percentage so that you get a leaner look, as demonstrated by the numerous before and after pictures available on the Internet.So, what's the secret to lowering body fat percentage in general?  It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.

I give 4 out 5; however, because P90X will require most people to make significant modifications, which the P90X package does not describe enough.  Modifications are the key to maximizing the benefits after spending 60-90 minutes per day workouts and not getting injured!  I recommend reading Amazon.com review and beachbody.com.  I add my perspectives here:1. Ab Ripper X:  For people with weak core muscles, P90 Ab Ripper 200 is superior than Ab Ripper X.  People with weak core muscles can experience back pain with Ab Ripper X exercises (In&Out; and Bicycles in particular), because they use back muscles to compensate for their weak core.  My back pain improved after strengthening my core muscles with Core Synergistics.  I recommend doing Core Synergistics earlier (say Week 0 with no weights or start out with P90X Lean Workout Schedule), substituting Ab Ripper 200 for Ab Ripper X once or twice a week, and doing some Pilates to learn how to engage your core muscles Pilates Workout for Dummies.2. Pull Ups:  Most people will not be able to do 15 pull ups at once or 120+ pull ups in a workout.  I started with 1 or 2, and got frustrated because of little improvement after 2-3 weeks.  I saw huge improvements when I learned the Negatives:  use a chair and legs to go up, but use only the arms to come down.  For an exercise I try to make the pull ups and the negatives add to 10.  Now, I do about 5-6 regular pull ups and 4-6 Negatives to make a set.3. Relaxation:  P90X is an intense program (it's extreme), and occasionally we need to step back, breathe, and relax.  P90X X Stretch and Yoga X are very helpful (Yoga X improved my downward dog like no other program because Tony attacks those dogs relentlessly!!); however, Tony has a remarkable ability to turn everything into an exercise and Yoga X just ain't relaxing.  For learning to breathe and relax, I recommend other yoga or stretch videos AM & PM Stretch.4. Diet:  For the first 2-3 weeks, I found protein shakes helpful to recover from intense fatigue.  However, I stopped that after week 4, and I ignore P90X diet.  Why bother with bars and shakes, when you can eat vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts?Overall, I recommend using other instructional materials to supplement P90X to maximize benefits, to prevent burn outs, and to prevent injuries.  Learning proper Pilates techniques to engage core muscles can go long ways. Great workout routine, really works if you can stick with it. I didn't give it 5, just because it is so demanding for time. You really have to almost set aside 2 hours minimum everyday just for the workout (including getting ready and showering). I know there's shorter workout routines out there but I feel like this one could be tweaked just a little bit. I am on my final week of P90X, and overall, am happy with my experience.  I won't repeat what many others have stated here, but I would like to list some things I've realized for people considering whether to start P90X or for people who have decided to do the program but haven't started yet.The three things I'm going to talk about are: Diet, Flexibility, and Pull-up strength.First off, P90X is designed as an overall fitness program, not as a weight training or weight loss program per se. As I see it, the main purpose is to lower your overall body fat percentage so that you get a leaner look, as demonstrated by the numerous before and after pictures available on the Internet.So, what's the secret to lowering body fat percentage in general?  It's mostly about the diet.  When you purchase the P90X DVD's, you will also receive a Nutrition Guide.  Most of the contents there, at least the number of servings you should be consuming in each roughly 30-day phase, is widely available on the Internet.In other words, if you are still considering whether to do P90X, you first need to ask yourself whether you are willing to commit to a strict diet plan, either the one specified by BeachBody, or any other sensible diet.  This is particularly true for guys who want to gain muscle.  You will have to make sure you consume plenty of protein.Therefore, even before purchasing P90X, I would at least try to structure and follow a diet plan for several weeks.  You may find either (1) You can't commit to such a diet and hence P90X may not be as effective for you, or (2) That you get many good results even without doing the P90X program.Secondly, P90X requires a great amount of flexibility.  This is especially true for two of the workouts in particular: Yoga X and Ab Ripper X.  If you are unable to touch your toes (either reaching down while standing up or reaching forward by sitting down), you will probably find these two workouts to be very frustrating.For example, there is a routine called Fifer Scissors in Ab Ripper X.  This exercise requires you to keep one leg straight up in the air while keeping the other leg just off of the ground.  When I try to do Fifer Scissors, I can't keep my leg straight; I have a bend in my knee.  For me, the problem isn't my abs.  It's that I don't have the flexibility to keep my leg straight in the first place.  Even if I keep my other leg *on* the ground, doing this exercise is difficult.In Yoga X, you will see some of the people, particularly the women, who can reach *beyond* their toes.  I'm sure I'm not the only guy who feels frustrated, especially from a psychological perspective, when I'm at least 6 inches away from my toes.In short, I would highly recommend making sure you are flexible - or at least flexible enough - to do things like touch your toes.  You don't need a P90X DVD to do this; there's plenty of advice on the Internet.  To this day, I can't touch my toes, although I have gotten closer.Obviously, this flexibility issue is not a criticism of P90X.  What I am saying is that you may want to make sure you have decent flexibility before starting the program.  You will find the program more effective...and more enjoyable at the same time.Lastly, you should be able to do at least several unassisted pullups if you're a guy and several pullups with a chair if you're a woman.  The program is difficult enough if you can do 7-8 unassisted pullups at the beginning; it seems nearly impossible if you can't even do one.Like the flexibility issue I mentioned above, seeing Tony Horton and his gang knock out 15+ pullups on Day 1 of the program (Chest and Back) is mentally very frustrating for someone like me, who could barely do one unassisted pullup.  I can now do about 7-8 unassisted pullups on my first set, but fewer during the later portion of a one-hour workout.  More importantly, I still can't do any "Switch-Grip Pullups" or "Corn Cob Pullups."  If you don't know what those are, don't worry, you'll get a kick out of seeing Tony do them on the videos.Once again, this pullup issue is not a criticism of P90X.  It is, however, something to be aware of when deciding whether you have the "prerequisite" to do the program.Overall Summary: I'm happy I did the program, and I did get good results, most notably a 3.5-inch waist size reduction.  My diet, while not totally conforming to the Nutrition Guide, was quite solid.  If I do another round of P90X, I will, however, make sure I can touch my toes first and be able to knock out 4-5 sets of 8+ unassisted pullups before going again.P90X is designed for people who have decent fitness already and want to get into great shape.  While you can still do the program even though you don't have all of the things I've mentioned, you will still get a lot out of it, but your results and enjoyment of the program won't be as high as someone with a solid diet plan and good flexibility and upper-body strength going into the program. First off the only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the discs was unplayable upon receipt and the guide had kind of wonky printing.  I imagine it was an irregular version of the system.  The damaged disc only came up in the rotation twice within the 12 week cycle.  Since it was a back & arm strength training one we swapped out for the other back trainer and still got great results!As far as shipping they were fast and efficient and the items were well packaged and protected.And now...the program.  My husband & I were looking for something we could do together, that would hold our interest and something that wouldn't cost a fortune, nor force us to go outside.  We're both relatively healthy but convenience foods and lack of exercise finally caught up in the past couple years.  After seeing the infomercial like 50 times for this program & noticing how much variety there was, we thought, why not give it a shot.Weeks 1-4 made us question our own sanity (haha) but as we settled into the next 8 weeks all I can say is our strength, stamina and health took a soaring leap up while fat % (and ability to deal with Tony's jokes, haha) took a strong decline!We didn't follow the nutrition guide to the letter but did make much healthier choices overall and consulted the guide for, well, guidance, regularly.  With the tools this program provides and the easy attitude of the man behind it all, Tony Horton, we were able to get amazing results using the "lighter" version -- lean.  We both intend to start up again just after the new year on a second run at the program but this time we're doing doubles.  This is a well rounded program and as long as you take your time and go at YOUR OWN PACE you WILL see results.  Looking forward to the second round in the new year & excited to be a P90X grad.BRING IT!! Bought the P90X program 3 weeks ago. Down almost 10 lbs now. This workout program is not for wimps. You have to be semi healthy just to warm up with this guy.Don't even try to keep up with the group, they have been doing this stuff for awhile, I'm pausing the CD every now and then to catch my breath.If I followed the diet program they sent me I'm sure I would have lost more weight. Not a fan of being hungry all the time. I like the variety of workouts in the package and expect to drop at least 25 lbs by the end of the 90 days. But you have to "bring it" Ok so here is my background (just finished phase 1 which took me 5 weeks instead of 4 due to a nasty sinus infection that put me in bed for 5 days)a year ago I was 6'2 240; went through a diet and exercise program down to 193 and ran my first urban athalon in December.I caught this on a lightening deal and figured it might be a great alternative to the gym/trainer which is very expensive and has limited hoursRight now I am at 186, stomach flatter/ general hip area more toned, my whole body appears lean at the moment (there are several versions of this program, and I am following the lean version; if I were to repeat it I may go for "size" to try to increase muscle mass, and I have some loose skin from loosing weight).  I didn't read the diet book and am just trying to "eat clean"The Good:The workouts are challenging, Tony Horten is funny and engaging, the workouts are well designed with warmup/stretching/breaks and cool downs... there is a strong emphasis on flexibility which I have found is keeping me from getting too many nagging injuries or muscle pulls; there is an emphasis on modification and taking breaks when you need them especially the first monthYou don't need a vast amount of equipment, a yoga mat and block is essential (less than $15 on amazon) a pair of medium weights (something you could curl 16 times) dumbbells and a pair of lighter dumbbells and a decent set of resistance bands (every weight exercise can be done with bands, I have found that I like mixing and matching, as some of the moves work better for me with the bands and others I like better with the dumbbells... they will suggest a pull up bar, which I have and have tried, however the sheer number of reps required and limited space in my workout area make this unattractive for me and I have done better using the bands in lieu of pullup barThe bad: (not really bad it's working for me; just stuff you should know if you are considering the program)You need to be in decent shape before you start; this is not a workout for beginners even with modifiers; if you are fresh off the couch pick something else and then come to this once you are in ok shapeThe workouts are long 60-90 minutes which can be tough to fit into your day (every video has 10 minutes of warmup/stretching and 5 minute cooldown which you honestly need given the intensity but the time must be set aside)... I have found I have to split the yoga sessions into 2 days because I can't do it for 90 minutes strait and my legs get too beat up if I try to do the whole video in one showingThe people in the video are in peak physical shape and are super flexible, you will find you cannot keep up with them the first several times through unless you are already trained really wellI will update again when I finish phase 2 This is an excellent, effective program for the individual who is committed and, more importantly, prepared.  I've been athletic all of my life, but I confess that my commitment started to trail off a few years back after an injury.  I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.  A great aspect of this workout program is the fact that you need very little to actually use it.A few dumbbells you can find at Wal-Mart, a 10 dollar door frame chin-up bar and a good, strong chunk of willpower is just about all you need. If you're like me and wanted to get something to use on the road while you're away from your basement gym, this is perfect.If you don't have a basement gym, this is still perfect.Not everyone has the same body type, and the people performing for you on this DVD reflect that. The people run the gambit of body types, from taller and bigger to leaner. It does a great job showing results possible for several different body types.A warning, this workout set will kick your body HARD at first. You will not be able to finish most of the workouts, don't hurt yourself trying to. Go as far as your muscles will allow you (your muscles will literally stop working. You will reach "failure" and that's what you want.) and then stop. Rest.Take it slow in the beginning. Try to ignore the pep-squad style yammering of the coach unless you need the encouragement and enjoy the results. My wife and I are in our late 50's and in so-so shape. We started on P90X about 3 weeks ago and can tell a difference already. To be honest, there are some exercises on the DVD's we just can't do, but we're trying to do our own modified version of them to keep the flow of the workout going. We did not purchase this product with the intention of "getting ripped" but we really can see some definition in the short amount of time we've used it. What we read on a couple of other reviews was exactly right: you get out of it what you put into it. That's true of any fitness program. This is a great presentation overall with easy to understand instruction on the different exercises and great nutritional info included as well. I am on Week 9 of P90X and the product works:  I went from 20 to 14 % body fat with muscle gains.

I decided that I wanted to get in the best shape I could over a reasonable period, so I started with "Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp."  (Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp) I've been a runner, hiker, skier, and, most recently, a cyclist, and I've participated in Body Pump sessions at my gym.  Most of my workouts in those sports have been casual, at least from the perspective of making an effort toward all-round fitness.  The Boot Camp really surprised me, because it produced results fairly quickly and didn't result in the sort of injuries and pains that, say, the Body Pump sessions sometimes did.  That was very significant, because I'm almost 60, and injuries seem to be coming more and more frequently these days.  I waited to mention that until I was a ways into the review, since I think my experience translates to people of all ages.  Having gotten fairly comfortable with the advanced level of the Boot Camp DVDs, I decided to move to P90X.  My experience, which I've noticed is shared by many of my acquaintances who've tried P90X, is that the transition is quite steep.  The "X" in the title really does stand for "Extreme."  Anyone who purchases this needs to be in very good shape already if they're going to get real benefits out of it without getting injured.  If you're a week-end warrior or an athlete who's taken a couple of years off, start with the Boot Camp DVD.  In fact, even if you consider yourself pretty fit, you'd be better off trying the Boot Camp DVD first, just to be certain that it's easy for you and that you're ready.  Another reason to get the Boot Camp DVD is that P90X requires a very significant time commitment (which I, as a lawyer, find difficult to make).  P90X is a series of 12 muscle-group-specific sessions of about 45 minutes to an hour each, whereas the Boot Camp DVD will give you a complete circuit in the same period.  If you're not able to commit that much time just about every day of the week, you may be better off doing the complete workout in the Boot Camp DVD a few days a week. I have never seen a home workout program that will get you the same results that hard work at a good gym will get you, but this one comes surprisingly close. If you follow this program with determination and intensity you will see results. You probably won't see the results that you see on the commercials (those are unrealistic), but you will still gain noticeable benefit from this program. Tony Horton is very entertaining and for the most part is great at explaining the exercises in a clear and concise manner. He comes across as knowledgeable, humble, and helpful. It feels as though he genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. The set also comes with a nutrition guide that I personally didn't follow but the program obviously encourages it. As with any workout program be sure to put form, technique, and your personal safety above all else. Be especially careful with your back. If your body is telling you no, then stop. Any potential gain you might be getting is not worth the potential injury. Also make sure to get some decent shoes, without them you can develop various issues in your knees, heels, or shins.My favorite DVDs in the set are without a doubt Core Synergistics, Ab Ripper X, Legs & Back, and Shoulders & Arms. All four are well designed and easy to follow and definitely push you if you give it your all. Yoga X is also very good but it's a little drawn out and I feel he doesn't give quite enough explanation or guidance with some of the poses. The other strength-based workouts such as Chest and Back, Plyometrics, Chest/Shoulders/Triceps, or Back and Biceps also do plenty to push you as long as you put in the effort. However, Cardio X and Kenpo X are both a little lackluster. Cardio X is one of the shorter workouts and is often used as a supplementary workout after your scheduled one for the day. As such it really doesn't push you very hard and will not keep your heart rate as high as it needs to be for extended periods of time. Kenpo X is borderline worthless. If you want a bland Tae Bo esque workout then you'll be right at home. It doesn't push you very hard, it's too long for what it is, and it's pretty boring. Also as someone who has been doing various forms of martial arts my whole life it was kind of embarrassing. What they're showing you is mostly wrong and I hope nobody ever tries to fight like that.Overall if you're looking to avoid the gym environment but still want to get in shape this is a good option for you. Just make sure to stay safe and give quality over quantity and you should see results. The program does a good job of working every part of your body but you might find it more useful to find alternative forms of cardio to give ourself a better workout over Kenpo X or Cardio X. Sometimes the workouts feel too long and it can be very time consuming, but stick with it and you'll be glad you did.
