I purchased the full P90X program from Amazon.  I really enjoy the workouts and I am in better shape thanks to P90X.  However, I need to caution my fellow Amazon customers that if you buy P90X from Amazon (e.g., by Beach Body fulfilled by Amazon) and a DVD is defective or damaged, neither Beach Body nor Amazon will honor a replacement.In my case, the CardioX DVD became defective just after a few uses.  I spoke to a Beach Body representative (in India) yesterday who stated that Beach Body only honors replacements for programs purchased from them directly. Now, normally buying DVDs from Amazon wouldn't be an issue, but too many customers including myself have found that a P90X DVD can become defective. I truly believe there is an inherent problem with how these DVDs are either manufactured and / or packaged because I've never had other DVDs go bad.Ultimately, I ended up buying the entire P90X program AGAIN directly from Beach Body with the lifetime DVD replacement guarantee for just $9.00 more.  I wasn't happy about it, but I found it was a better deal in the long run than replacing one DVD at a time for $30 plus shipping and handling (without a lifetime guarantee).  To reiterate, I'm a  P90X believer (five stars), but Beach Body does not offer customer support for programs sold by our favorite retailer (one star).  Can you imagine if this were the policy for all manufacturers sold by Amazon?  My own purchases would drop by at least 75 percent.  Amazon buyer beware. I was torn between selecting 1 star rating for the product received, in essence the DVDs, or the 5 star rating for the program itself, which I believe to be great. But what good is the program if you cannot play it on your DVD player? Simple answer is "the product is useless". The DVDs are substandard and one by one are becoming unreadable by the DVD player.  I brought up the issue with amazon.com and I was offered a $5 discount applicable to my next purchase.  BeachBody customer service asked for an order number at first, but once they learned I purchased the product from amazon.com, the communication ceased. Now, what was a saving of a few dollars by purchasing this product from amazon.com became a total loss of $153.As an update:Amazon.com customer service replied to my inquiry and offered to give me a $5.00 rebate to be use on any future purchase...Generous, I guess...kind of...I thought initially, until I managed to have a long discussion with a Beachbody.com customer service rep.  In fact, I found out that Beachbody.com offers a $13.90 insurance upon purchase of their product for the lifetime free replacement of any damaged DVD.  Such an insurance is not available through Amazon.com...Why? hmmm, is it possible Beachbody.com as some sort of quality control of their DVDs and sells such rejects through Amazon.com? ...Amazon.com will give you a $5.00 rebate to make you a happy customer...in essence to hush you.As a suggestion for any future buyers.....Buys from Beachbody.com directly and purchase the insurance offered, bypass Amazon.com. If you think this will not happen to you, just read the 1 star reviewers and you ll see this is a very common problem. We are so disappointed in this product from tryagain.  My bad, I wanted to save a few bucks and ended up paying about $90.  The thing looked new, shrink wrapped and everything but from day 1, it would not work well for us. From day 1, the dvds would freeze and would hardly play with normal dvd players. Probably 3 out of the whole set would work okay. We have 5 dvd players and it only plays on 1 and now that it's almost a year old would not play well on that one (BOSE) either. We have The Sony portable DVD player (does not work there, it freezes), Apple Macbook (it freezes the whole computer and we have to shut down for it to come back on), Toshiba portable DVD player (freezes as well), we also have a regular Toshiba dvd player and it does not work there.  It only plays on our Bose, and I guess Bose is really powerful if it can play this crap.  All of our DVD players are of high quality so the problem really is with the DVDs. We tried cleaning the backs, etc. nothing works. What a waste of $90, should have gone with the full price from the get go.What's the point of having dvd's when you can't take it on a trip with you, nor play at another part of the house?I contacted the seller, copying Amazon twice, no response.  We will be buying a second set, most probably direct from Beach Body so  we won't get taken by Amazon's tryagain seller. Wary of buying from Amazon as well direct.Very disappointing. I would highly recommend that you avoid this store.  We purchased a P90x workout program.  Everything arrived quickly and appeared to be in good order: books, DVDs, and boxes in what appeared to be original packaging.  However, only one of the DVDs will play in a normal DVD player (I've tried to play them in three different players) & some don't work in computers.  Bottom line: we're incredibly disappointed.  An absolutely defected item in a well-packaged box.To add insult to injury, the proprietor never responded to our email requesting either a replacement or a refund.  Save yourself time and aggravation.  Go elsewhere. I have found my experience with this product to be very dissappointing. I purchsed the DVD's from amazon and some of them did not work so I responded to amazon who referred me to Beachbody. I contacted beachbody by email and live chat on numerous occassions  and did not get any reply to an email except the automated replies. The live chat assured me they would be back to me within 3 business days. It is now over 1 months since I have been trying to resolve and amazon will no  longer offer full refund and beachbody do not respond. The links to their contact page on the site are also broken. I have heard similar horror stories from friends who have purchased insanity. A great exercise program that is not backed up by any custmer service, frstrating and very dissappointing. My purchase of P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner by Beachbody came to me quickly and packaged well however the CDs do not work properly!  They are unreadable in all my DVD players and my computer.  Thankfully I have a portable DVD player that reads them so I have to attach that to my TV to do the videos.  Do not waste your money on purchasing this set because chances are they will not work for you.  Spend a little more and buy it from the actual website!P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner Just found out that "E-shop LLC" which is who Amazon used, sold me a fake copy.  I paid a total of $129.99 and am not happy that I got a fake.  The only real copies come from Beachbody. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! BUY FROM BEACH BODY DIRECTLY! I love P90X BUT I wish I had gone by others recommendations and bought from Beach Body.com. I had borrowed this set from a friend and couldn't complete it because I had broken my hand and gave it back to her, so I knew what the real set should look like. What I received was thinner, smaller books (with I believe all of the right info, though) and the DVD case itself was thin paper, unlike the sturdy original which doesn't bend at all. The DVD's themselves appeared as if there were oil stains or other markings on them, no scratches, but they would skip throughout and just stop one of them does not work AT ALL- right out of the box! Also, the beginning of the real P90X gives you the option of playing it with Tony Horton rambling throughout, and a version where you can mute him except for the important parts. These DVD's were so poorly done that it APPEARS to have this option, however you can only select the first one, and if you've done these before, you know Tony can get pretty old, pretty fast.That being said, overall I love P90X, but shouldn't have been so darn cheap in the first place. I would have sent this right back, however I didn't even know it was a scam until it was too late. I opened the package much after I had spent the time and money to  build my workout station. Guess that cheap price truly is too good to be true. The cd's seem cheap and skip we are happy with the workouts but not happy with the cd's .  The cd starts out good but then starts skipping.  You can just keep watching and it will start working but you miss part of the workout. Did not get half way through the 90days before DVDs started skipping and some quit playing all together. I tried to call customer service and received no help. Wouldn't buy it again or recommend the Dvd's to anyone. Downloading the workouts from internet is the only way to ensure the best quality over time.  I purchased the full P90X program from Amazon.

These DVD's were so poorly done that it APPEARS to have this option, however you can only select the first one, and if you've done these before, you know Tony can get pretty old, pretty fast.That being said, overall I love P90X, but shouldn't have been so darn cheap in the first place. I would have sent this right back, however I didn't even know it was a scam until it was too late. I opened the package much after I had spent the time and money to  build my workout station. Guess that cheap price truly is too good to be true. The cd's seem cheap and skip we are happy with the workouts but not happy with the cd's .  The cd starts out good but then starts skipping.  You can just keep watching and it will start working but you miss part of the workout. Did not get half way through the 90days before DVDs started skipping and some quit playing all together. I tried to call customer service and received no help. Wouldn't buy it again or recommend the Dvd's to anyone. Downloading the workouts from internet is the only way to ensure the best quality over time.  I purchased the full P90X program from Amazon.  I really enjoy the workouts and I am in better shape thanks to P90X.  However, I need to caution my fellow Amazon customers that if you buy P90X from Amazon (e.g., by Beach Body fulfilled by Amazon) and a DVD is defective or damaged, neither Beach Body nor Amazon will honor a replacement.In my case, the CardioX DVD became defective just after a few uses.  I spoke to a Beach Body representative (in India) yesterday who stated that Beach Body only honors replacements for programs purchased from them directly. Now, normally buying DVDs from Amazon wouldn't be an issue, but too many customers including myself have found that a P90X DVD can become defective. I truly believe there is an inherent problem with how these DVDs are either manufactured and / or packaged because I've never had other DVDs go bad.Ultimately, I ended up buying the entire P90X program AGAIN directly from Beach Body with the lifetime DVD replacement guarantee for just $9.00 more.  I wasn't happy about it, but I found it was a better deal in the long run than replacing one DVD at a time for $30 plus shipping and handling (without a lifetime guarantee).  To reiterate, I'm a  P90X believer (five stars), but Beach Body does not offer customer support for programs sold by our favorite retailer (one star).  Can you imagine if this were the policy for all manufacturers sold by Amazon?  My own purchases would drop by at least 75 percent.  Amazon buyer beware. I was torn between selecting 1 star rating for the product received, in essence the DVDs, or the 5 star rating for the program itself, which I believe to be great. But what good is the program if you cannot play it on your DVD player? Simple answer is "the product is useless". The DVDs are substandard and one by one are becoming unreadable by the DVD player.  I brought up the issue with amazon.com and I was offered a $5 discount applicable to my next purchase.  BeachBody customer service asked for an order number at first, but once they learned I purchased the product from amazon.com, the communication ceased. Now, what was a saving of a few dollars by purchasing this product from amazon.com became a total loss of $153.As an update:Amazon.com customer service replied to my inquiry and offered to give me a $5.00 rebate to be use on any future purchase...Generous, I guess...kind of...I thought initially, until I managed to have a long discussion with a Beachbody.com customer service rep.  In fact, I found out that Beachbody.com offers a $13.90 insurance upon purchase of their product for the lifetime free replacement of any damaged DVD.  Such an insurance is not available through Amazon.com...Why? hmmm, is it possible Beachbody.com as some sort of quality control of their DVDs and sells such rejects through Amazon.com? ...Amazon.com will give you a $5.00 rebate to make you a happy customer...in essence to hush you.As a suggestion for any future buyers.....Buys from Beachbody.com directly and purchase the insurance offered, bypass Amazon.com. If you think this will not happen to you, just read the 1 star reviewers and you ll see this is a very common problem. We are so disappointed in this product from tryagain.  My bad, I wanted to save a few bucks and ended up paying about $90.  The thing looked new, shrink wrapped and everything but from day 1, it would not work well for us. From day 1, the dvds would freeze and would hardly play with normal dvd players. Probably 3 out of the whole set would work okay. We have 5 dvd players and it only plays on 1 and now that it's almost a year old would not play well on that one (BOSE) either. We have The Sony portable DVD player (does not work there, it freezes), Apple Macbook (it freezes the whole computer and we have to shut down for it to come back on), Toshiba portable DVD player (freezes as well), we also have a regular Toshiba dvd player and it does not work there.  It only plays on our Bose, and I guess Bose is really powerful if it can play this crap.  All of our DVD players are of high quality so the problem really is with the DVDs. We tried cleaning the backs, etc. nothing works. What a waste of $90, should have gone with the full price from the get go.What's the point of having dvd's when you can't take it on a trip with you, nor play at another part of the house?I contacted the seller, copying Amazon twice, no response.  We will be buying a second set, most probably direct from Beach Body so  we won't get taken by Amazon's tryagain seller. Wary of buying from Amazon as well direct.Very disappointing. I would highly recommend that you avoid this store.  We purchased a P90x workout program.  Everything arrived quickly and appeared to be in good order: books, DVDs, and boxes in what appeared to be original packaging.  However, only one of the DVDs will play in a normal DVD player (I've tried to play them in three different players) & some don't work in computers.  Bottom line: we're incredibly disappointed.  An absolutely defected item in a well-packaged box.To add insult to injury, the proprietor never responded to our email requesting either a replacement or a refund.  Save yourself time and aggravation.  Go elsewhere. I have found my experience with this product to be very dissappointing. I purchsed the DVD's from amazon and some of them did not work so I responded to amazon who referred me to Beachbody. I contacted beachbody by email and live chat on numerous occassions  and did not get any reply to an email except the automated replies. The live chat assured me they would be back to me within 3 business days. It is now over 1 months since I have been trying to resolve and amazon will no  longer offer full refund and beachbody do not respond. The links to their contact page on the site are also broken. I have heard similar horror stories from friends who have purchased insanity. A great exercise program that is not backed up by any custmer service, frstrating and very dissappointing. My purchase of P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner by Beachbody came to me quickly and packaged well however the CDs do not work properly!  They are unreadable in all my DVD players and my computer.  Thankfully I have a portable DVD player that reads them so I have to attach that to my TV to do the videos.  Do not waste your money on purchasing this set because chances are they will not work for you.  Spend a little more and buy it from the actual website!P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner Just found out that "E-shop LLC" which is who Amazon used, sold me a fake copy.  I paid a total of $129.99 and am not happy that I got a fake.  The only real copies come from Beachbody. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! BUY FROM BEACH BODY DIRECTLY! I love P90X BUT I wish I had gone by others recommendations and bought from Beach Body.com. I had borrowed this set from a friend and couldn't complete it because I had broken my hand and gave it back to her, so I knew what the real set should look like. What I received was thinner, smaller books (with I believe all of the right info, though) and the DVD case itself was thin paper, unlike the sturdy original which doesn't bend at all.

Do not waste your money on purchasing this set because chances are they will not work for you.  Spend a little more and buy it from the actual website!P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner Just found out that "E-shop LLC" which is who Amazon used, sold me a fake copy.  I paid a total of $129.99 and am not happy that I got a fake.  The only real copies come from Beachbody. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! BUY FROM BEACH BODY DIRECTLY! I love P90X BUT I wish I had gone by others recommendations and bought from Beach Body.com. I had borrowed this set from a friend and couldn't complete it because I had broken my hand and gave it back to her, so I knew what the real set should look like. What I received was thinner, smaller books (with I believe all of the right info, though) and the DVD case itself was thin paper, unlike the sturdy original which doesn't bend at all. The DVD's themselves appeared as if there were oil stains or other markings on them, no scratches, but they would skip throughout and just stop one of them does not work AT ALL- right out of the box! Also, the beginning of the real P90X gives you the option of playing it with Tony Horton rambling throughout, and a version where you can mute him except for the important parts. These DVD's were so poorly done that it APPEARS to have this option, however you can only select the first one, and if you've done these before, you know Tony can get pretty old, pretty fast.That being said, overall I love P90X, but shouldn't have been so darn cheap in the first place. I would have sent this right back, however I didn't even know it was a scam until it was too late. I opened the package much after I had spent the time and money to  build my workout station. Guess that cheap price truly is too good to be true. The cd's seem cheap and skip we are happy with the workouts but not happy with the cd's .  The cd starts out good but then starts skipping.  You can just keep watching and it will start working but you miss part of the workout. Did not get half way through the 90days before DVDs started skipping and some quit playing all together. I tried to call customer service and received no help. Wouldn't buy it again or recommend the Dvd's to anyone. Downloading the workouts from internet is the only way to ensure the best quality over time.  I purchased the full P90X program from Amazon.  I really enjoy the workouts and I am in better shape thanks to P90X.  However, I need to caution my fellow Amazon customers that if you buy P90X from Amazon (e.g., by Beach Body fulfilled by Amazon) and a DVD is defective or damaged, neither Beach Body nor Amazon will honor a replacement.In my case, the CardioX DVD became defective just after a few uses.  I spoke to a Beach Body representative (in India) yesterday who stated that Beach Body only honors replacements for programs purchased from them directly. Now, normally buying DVDs from Amazon wouldn't be an issue, but too many customers including myself have found that a P90X DVD can become defective. I truly believe there is an inherent problem with how these DVDs are either manufactured and / or packaged because I've never had other DVDs go bad.Ultimately, I ended up buying the entire P90X program AGAIN directly from Beach Body with the lifetime DVD replacement guarantee for just $9.00 more.  I wasn't happy about it, but I found it was a better deal in the long run than replacing one DVD at a time for $30 plus shipping and handling (without a lifetime guarantee).  To reiterate, I'm a  P90X believer (five stars), but Beach Body does not offer customer support for programs sold by our favorite retailer (one star).  Can you imagine if this were the policy for all manufacturers sold by Amazon?  My own purchases would drop by at least 75 percent.  Amazon buyer beware. I was torn between selecting 1 star rating for the product received, in essence the DVDs, or the 5 star rating for the program itself, which I believe to be great. But what good is the program if you cannot play it on your DVD player? Simple answer is "the product is useless". The DVDs are substandard and one by one are becoming unreadable by the DVD player.  I brought up the issue with amazon.com and I was offered a $5 discount applicable to my next purchase.  BeachBody customer service asked for an order number at first, but once they learned I purchased the product from amazon.com, the communication ceased. Now, what was a saving of a few dollars by purchasing this product from amazon.com became a total loss of $153.As an update:Amazon.com customer service replied to my inquiry and offered to give me a $5.00 rebate to be use on any future purchase...Generous, I guess...kind of...I thought initially, until I managed to have a long discussion with a Beachbody.com customer service rep.  In fact, I found out that Beachbody.com offers a $13.90 insurance upon purchase of their product for the lifetime free replacement of any damaged DVD.  Such an insurance is not available through Amazon.com...Why? hmmm, is it possible Beachbody.com as some sort of quality control of their DVDs and sells such rejects through Amazon.com? ...Amazon.com will give you a $5.00 rebate to make you a happy customer...in essence to hush you.As a suggestion for any future buyers.....Buys from Beachbody.com directly and purchase the insurance offered, bypass Amazon.com. If you think this will not happen to you, just read the 1 star reviewers and you ll see this is a very common problem. We are so disappointed in this product from tryagain.  My bad, I wanted to save a few bucks and ended up paying about $90.  The thing looked new, shrink wrapped and everything but from day 1, it would not work well for us. From day 1, the dvds would freeze and would hardly play with normal dvd players. Probably 3 out of the whole set would work okay. We have 5 dvd players and it only plays on 1 and now that it's almost a year old would not play well on that one (BOSE) either. We have The Sony portable DVD player (does not work there, it freezes), Apple Macbook (it freezes the whole computer and we have to shut down for it to come back on), Toshiba portable DVD player (freezes as well), we also have a regular Toshiba dvd player and it does not work there.  It only plays on our Bose, and I guess Bose is really powerful if it can play this crap.  All of our DVD players are of high quality so the problem really is with the DVDs. We tried cleaning the backs, etc. nothing works. What a waste of $90, should have gone with the full price from the get go.What's the point of having dvd's when you can't take it on a trip with you, nor play at another part of the house?I contacted the seller, copying Amazon twice, no response.  We will be buying a second set, most probably direct from Beach Body so  we won't get taken by Amazon's tryagain seller. Wary of buying from Amazon as well direct.Very disappointing. I would highly recommend that you avoid this store.  We purchased a P90x workout program.  Everything arrived quickly and appeared to be in good order: books, DVDs, and boxes in what appeared to be original packaging.  However, only one of the DVDs will play in a normal DVD player (I've tried to play them in three different players) & some don't work in computers.  Bottom line: we're incredibly disappointed.  An absolutely defected item in a well-packaged box.To add insult to injury, the proprietor never responded to our email requesting either a replacement or a refund.  Save yourself time and aggravation.  Go elsewhere. I have found my experience with this product to be very dissappointing. I purchsed the DVD's from amazon and some of them did not work so I responded to amazon who referred me to Beachbody. I contacted beachbody by email and live chat on numerous occassions  and did not get any reply to an email except the automated replies. The live chat assured me they would be back to me within 3 business days. It is now over 1 months since I have been trying to resolve and amazon will no  longer offer full refund and beachbody do not respond. The links to their contact page on the site are also broken. I have heard similar horror stories from friends who have purchased insanity. A great exercise program that is not backed up by any custmer service, frstrating and very dissappointing.

However, only one of the DVDs will play in a normal DVD player (I've tried to play them in three different players) & some don't work in computers.  Bottom line: we're incredibly disappointed.  An absolutely defected item in a well-packaged box.To add insult to injury, the proprietor never responded to our email requesting either a replacement or a refund.  Save yourself time and aggravation.  Go elsewhere. I have found my experience with this product to be very dissappointing. I purchsed the DVD's from amazon and some of them did not work so I responded to amazon who referred me to Beachbody. I contacted beachbody by email and live chat on numerous occassions  and did not get any reply to an email except the automated replies. The live chat assured me they would be back to me within 3 business days. It is now over 1 months since I have been trying to resolve and amazon will no  longer offer full refund and beachbody do not respond. The links to their contact page on the site are also broken. I have heard similar horror stories from friends who have purchased insanity. A great exercise program that is not backed up by any custmer service, frstrating and very dissappointing. My purchase of P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner by Beachbody came to me quickly and packaged well however the CDs do not work properly!  They are unreadable in all my DVD players and my computer.  Thankfully I have a portable DVD player that reads them so I have to attach that to my TV to do the videos.  Do not waste your money on purchasing this set because chances are they will not work for you.  Spend a little more and buy it from the actual website!P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner Just found out that "E-shop LLC" which is who Amazon used, sold me a fake copy.  I paid a total of $129.99 and am not happy that I got a fake.  The only real copies come from Beachbody. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! BUY FROM BEACH BODY DIRECTLY! I love P90X BUT I wish I had gone by others recommendations and bought from Beach Body.com. I had borrowed this set from a friend and couldn't complete it because I had broken my hand and gave it back to her, so I knew what the real set should look like. What I received was thinner, smaller books (with I believe all of the right info, though) and the DVD case itself was thin paper, unlike the sturdy original which doesn't bend at all. The DVD's themselves appeared as if there were oil stains or other markings on them, no scratches, but they would skip throughout and just stop one of them does not work AT ALL- right out of the box! Also, the beginning of the real P90X gives you the option of playing it with Tony Horton rambling throughout, and a version where you can mute him except for the important parts. These DVD's were so poorly done that it APPEARS to have this option, however you can only select the first one, and if you've done these before, you know Tony can get pretty old, pretty fast.That being said, overall I love P90X, but shouldn't have been so darn cheap in the first place. I would have sent this right back, however I didn't even know it was a scam until it was too late. I opened the package much after I had spent the time and money to  build my workout station. Guess that cheap price truly is too good to be true. The cd's seem cheap and skip we are happy with the workouts but not happy with the cd's .  The cd starts out good but then starts skipping.  You can just keep watching and it will start working but you miss part of the workout. Did not get half way through the 90days before DVDs started skipping and some quit playing all together. I tried to call customer service and received no help. Wouldn't buy it again or recommend the Dvd's to anyone. Downloading the workouts from internet is the only way to ensure the best quality over time.  I purchased the full P90X program from Amazon.  I really enjoy the workouts and I am in better shape thanks to P90X.  However, I need to caution my fellow Amazon customers that if you buy P90X from Amazon (e.g., by Beach Body fulfilled by Amazon) and a DVD is defective or damaged, neither Beach Body nor Amazon will honor a replacement.In my case, the CardioX DVD became defective just after a few uses.  I spoke to a Beach Body representative (in India) yesterday who stated that Beach Body only honors replacements for programs purchased from them directly. Now, normally buying DVDs from Amazon wouldn't be an issue, but too many customers including myself have found that a P90X DVD can become defective. I truly believe there is an inherent problem with how these DVDs are either manufactured and / or packaged because I've never had other DVDs go bad.Ultimately, I ended up buying the entire P90X program AGAIN directly from Beach Body with the lifetime DVD replacement guarantee for just $9.00 more.  I wasn't happy about it, but I found it was a better deal in the long run than replacing one DVD at a time for $30 plus shipping and handling (without a lifetime guarantee).  To reiterate, I'm a  P90X believer (five stars), but Beach Body does not offer customer support for programs sold by our favorite retailer (one star).  Can you imagine if this were the policy for all manufacturers sold by Amazon?  My own purchases would drop by at least 75 percent.  Amazon buyer beware. I was torn between selecting 1 star rating for the product received, in essence the DVDs, or the 5 star rating for the program itself, which I believe to be great. But what good is the program if you cannot play it on your DVD player? Simple answer is "the product is useless". The DVDs are substandard and one by one are becoming unreadable by the DVD player.  I brought up the issue with amazon.com and I was offered a $5 discount applicable to my next purchase.  BeachBody customer service asked for an order number at first, but once they learned I purchased the product from amazon.com, the communication ceased. Now, what was a saving of a few dollars by purchasing this product from amazon.com became a total loss of $153.As an update:Amazon.com customer service replied to my inquiry and offered to give me a $5.00 rebate to be use on any future purchase...Generous, I guess...kind of...I thought initially, until I managed to have a long discussion with a Beachbody.com customer service rep.  In fact, I found out that Beachbody.com offers a $13.90 insurance upon purchase of their product for the lifetime free replacement of any damaged DVD.  Such an insurance is not available through Amazon.com...Why? hmmm, is it possible Beachbody.com as some sort of quality control of their DVDs and sells such rejects through Amazon.com? ...Amazon.com will give you a $5.00 rebate to make you a happy customer...in essence to hush you.As a suggestion for any future buyers.....Buys from Beachbody.com directly and purchase the insurance offered, bypass Amazon.com. If you think this will not happen to you, just read the 1 star reviewers and you ll see this is a very common problem. We are so disappointed in this product from tryagain.  My bad, I wanted to save a few bucks and ended up paying about $90.  The thing looked new, shrink wrapped and everything but from day 1, it would not work well for us. From day 1, the dvds would freeze and would hardly play with normal dvd players. Probably 3 out of the whole set would work okay. We have 5 dvd players and it only plays on 1 and now that it's almost a year old would not play well on that one (BOSE) either. We have The Sony portable DVD player (does not work there, it freezes), Apple Macbook (it freezes the whole computer and we have to shut down for it to come back on), Toshiba portable DVD player (freezes as well), we also have a regular Toshiba dvd player and it does not work there.  It only plays on our Bose, and I guess Bose is really powerful if it can play this crap.  All of our DVD players are of high quality so the problem really is with the DVDs. We tried cleaning the backs, etc. nothing works. What a waste of $90, should have gone with the full price from the get go.What's the point of having dvd's when you can't take it on a trip with you, nor play at another part of the house?I contacted the seller, copying Amazon twice, no response.  We will be buying a second set, most probably direct from Beach Body so  we won't get taken by Amazon's tryagain seller. Wary of buying from Amazon as well direct.Very disappointing.

We have 5 dvd players and it only plays on 1 and now that it's almost a year old would not play well on that one (BOSE) either. We have The Sony portable DVD player (does not work there, it freezes), Apple Macbook (it freezes the whole computer and we have to shut down for it to come back on), Toshiba portable DVD player (freezes as well), we also have a regular Toshiba dvd player and it does not work there.  It only plays on our Bose, and I guess Bose is really powerful if it can play this crap.  All of our DVD players are of high quality so the problem really is with the DVDs. We tried cleaning the backs, etc. nothing works. What a waste of $90, should have gone with the full price from the get go.What's the point of having dvd's when you can't take it on a trip with you, nor play at another part of the house?I contacted the seller, copying Amazon twice, no response.  We will be buying a second set, most probably direct from Beach Body so  we won't get taken by Amazon's tryagain seller. Wary of buying from Amazon as well direct.Very disappointing. I would highly recommend that you avoid this store.  We purchased a P90x workout program.  Everything arrived quickly and appeared to be in good order: books, DVDs, and boxes in what appeared to be original packaging.  However, only one of the DVDs will play in a normal DVD player (I've tried to play them in three different players) & some don't work in computers.  Bottom line: we're incredibly disappointed.  An absolutely defected item in a well-packaged box.To add insult to injury, the proprietor never responded to our email requesting either a replacement or a refund.  Save yourself time and aggravation.  Go elsewhere. I have found my experience with this product to be very dissappointing. I purchsed the DVD's from amazon and some of them did not work so I responded to amazon who referred me to Beachbody. I contacted beachbody by email and live chat on numerous occassions  and did not get any reply to an email except the automated replies. The live chat assured me they would be back to me within 3 business days. It is now over 1 months since I have been trying to resolve and amazon will no  longer offer full refund and beachbody do not respond. The links to their contact page on the site are also broken. I have heard similar horror stories from friends who have purchased insanity. A great exercise program that is not backed up by any custmer service, frstrating and very dissappointing. My purchase of P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner by Beachbody came to me quickly and packaged well however the CDs do not work properly!  They are unreadable in all my DVD players and my computer.  Thankfully I have a portable DVD player that reads them so I have to attach that to my TV to do the videos.  Do not waste your money on purchasing this set because chances are they will not work for you.  Spend a little more and buy it from the actual website!P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner Just found out that "E-shop LLC" which is who Amazon used, sold me a fake copy.  I paid a total of $129.99 and am not happy that I got a fake.  The only real copies come from Beachbody. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! BUY FROM BEACH BODY DIRECTLY! I love P90X BUT I wish I had gone by others recommendations and bought from Beach Body.com. I had borrowed this set from a friend and couldn't complete it because I had broken my hand and gave it back to her, so I knew what the real set should look like. What I received was thinner, smaller books (with I believe all of the right info, though) and the DVD case itself was thin paper, unlike the sturdy original which doesn't bend at all. The DVD's themselves appeared as if there were oil stains or other markings on them, no scratches, but they would skip throughout and just stop one of them does not work AT ALL- right out of the box! Also, the beginning of the real P90X gives you the option of playing it with Tony Horton rambling throughout, and a version where you can mute him except for the important parts. These DVD's were so poorly done that it APPEARS to have this option, however you can only select the first one, and if you've done these before, you know Tony can get pretty old, pretty fast.That being said, overall I love P90X, but shouldn't have been so darn cheap in the first place. I would have sent this right back, however I didn't even know it was a scam until it was too late. I opened the package much after I had spent the time and money to  build my workout station. Guess that cheap price truly is too good to be true. The cd's seem cheap and skip we are happy with the workouts but not happy with the cd's .  The cd starts out good but then starts skipping.  You can just keep watching and it will start working but you miss part of the workout. Did not get half way through the 90days before DVDs started skipping and some quit playing all together. I tried to call customer service and received no help. Wouldn't buy it again or recommend the Dvd's to anyone. Downloading the workouts from internet is the only way to ensure the best quality over time.  I purchased the full P90X program from Amazon.  I really enjoy the workouts and I am in better shape thanks to P90X.  However, I need to caution my fellow Amazon customers that if you buy P90X from Amazon (e.g., by Beach Body fulfilled by Amazon) and a DVD is defective or damaged, neither Beach Body nor Amazon will honor a replacement.In my case, the CardioX DVD became defective just after a few uses.  I spoke to a Beach Body representative (in India) yesterday who stated that Beach Body only honors replacements for programs purchased from them directly. Now, normally buying DVDs from Amazon wouldn't be an issue, but too many customers including myself have found that a P90X DVD can become defective. I truly believe there is an inherent problem with how these DVDs are either manufactured and / or packaged because I've never had other DVDs go bad.Ultimately, I ended up buying the entire P90X program AGAIN directly from Beach Body with the lifetime DVD replacement guarantee for just $9.00 more.  I wasn't happy about it, but I found it was a better deal in the long run than replacing one DVD at a time for $30 plus shipping and handling (without a lifetime guarantee).  To reiterate, I'm a  P90X believer (five stars), but Beach Body does not offer customer support for programs sold by our favorite retailer (one star).  Can you imagine if this were the policy for all manufacturers sold by Amazon?  My own purchases would drop by at least 75 percent.  Amazon buyer beware. I was torn between selecting 1 star rating for the product received, in essence the DVDs, or the 5 star rating for the program itself, which I believe to be great. But what good is the program if you cannot play it on your DVD player? Simple answer is "the product is useless". The DVDs are substandard and one by one are becoming unreadable by the DVD player.  I brought up the issue with amazon.com and I was offered a $5 discount applicable to my next purchase.  BeachBody customer service asked for an order number at first, but once they learned I purchased the product from amazon.com, the communication ceased. Now, what was a saving of a few dollars by purchasing this product from amazon.com became a total loss of $153.As an update:Amazon.com customer service replied to my inquiry and offered to give me a $5.00 rebate to be use on any future purchase...Generous, I guess...kind of...I thought initially, until I managed to have a long discussion with a Beachbody.com customer service rep.  In fact, I found out that Beachbody.com offers a $13.90 insurance upon purchase of their product for the lifetime free replacement of any damaged DVD.  Such an insurance is not available through Amazon.com...Why? hmmm, is it possible Beachbody.com as some sort of quality control of their DVDs and sells such rejects through Amazon.com? ...Amazon.com will give you a $5.00 rebate to make you a happy customer...in essence to hush you.As a suggestion for any future buyers.....Buys from Beachbody.com directly and purchase the insurance offered, bypass Amazon.com. If you think this will not happen to you, just read the 1 star reviewers and you ll see this is a very common problem. We are so disappointed in this product from tryagain.

Now, what was a saving of a few dollars by purchasing this product from amazon.com became a total loss of $153.As an update:Amazon.com customer service replied to my inquiry and offered to give me a $5.00 rebate to be use on any future purchase...Generous, I guess...kind of...I thought initially, until I managed to have a long discussion with a Beachbody.com customer service rep.  In fact, I found out that Beachbody.com offers a $13.90 insurance upon purchase of their product for the lifetime free replacement of any damaged DVD.  Such an insurance is not available through Amazon.com...Why? hmmm, is it possible Beachbody.com as some sort of quality control of their DVDs and sells such rejects through Amazon.com? ...Amazon.com will give you a $5.00 rebate to make you a happy customer...in essence to hush you.As a suggestion for any future buyers.....Buys from Beachbody.com directly and purchase the insurance offered, bypass Amazon.com. If you think this will not happen to you, just read the 1 star reviewers and you ll see this is a very common problem. We are so disappointed in this product from tryagain.  My bad, I wanted to save a few bucks and ended up paying about $90.  The thing looked new, shrink wrapped and everything but from day 1, it would not work well for us. From day 1, the dvds would freeze and would hardly play with normal dvd players. Probably 3 out of the whole set would work okay. We have 5 dvd players and it only plays on 1 and now that it's almost a year old would not play well on that one (BOSE) either. We have The Sony portable DVD player (does not work there, it freezes), Apple Macbook (it freezes the whole computer and we have to shut down for it to come back on), Toshiba portable DVD player (freezes as well), we also have a regular Toshiba dvd player and it does not work there.  It only plays on our Bose, and I guess Bose is really powerful if it can play this crap.  All of our DVD players are of high quality so the problem really is with the DVDs. We tried cleaning the backs, etc. nothing works. What a waste of $90, should have gone with the full price from the get go.What's the point of having dvd's when you can't take it on a trip with you, nor play at another part of the house?I contacted the seller, copying Amazon twice, no response.  We will be buying a second set, most probably direct from Beach Body so  we won't get taken by Amazon's tryagain seller. Wary of buying from Amazon as well direct.Very disappointing. I would highly recommend that you avoid this store.  We purchased a P90x workout program.  Everything arrived quickly and appeared to be in good order: books, DVDs, and boxes in what appeared to be original packaging.  However, only one of the DVDs will play in a normal DVD player (I've tried to play them in three different players) & some don't work in computers.  Bottom line: we're incredibly disappointed.  An absolutely defected item in a well-packaged box.To add insult to injury, the proprietor never responded to our email requesting either a replacement or a refund.  Save yourself time and aggravation.  Go elsewhere. I have found my experience with this product to be very dissappointing. I purchsed the DVD's from amazon and some of them did not work so I responded to amazon who referred me to Beachbody. I contacted beachbody by email and live chat on numerous occassions  and did not get any reply to an email except the automated replies. The live chat assured me they would be back to me within 3 business days. It is now over 1 months since I have been trying to resolve and amazon will no  longer offer full refund and beachbody do not respond. The links to their contact page on the site are also broken. I have heard similar horror stories from friends who have purchased insanity. A great exercise program that is not backed up by any custmer service, frstrating and very dissappointing. My purchase of P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner by Beachbody came to me quickly and packaged well however the CDs do not work properly!  They are unreadable in all my DVD players and my computer.  Thankfully I have a portable DVD player that reads them so I have to attach that to my TV to do the videos.  Do not waste your money on purchasing this set because chances are they will not work for you.  Spend a little more and buy it from the actual website!P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner Just found out that "E-shop LLC" which is who Amazon used, sold me a fake copy.  I paid a total of $129.99 and am not happy that I got a fake.  The only real copies come from Beachbody. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! BUY FROM BEACH BODY DIRECTLY! I love P90X BUT I wish I had gone by others recommendations and bought from Beach Body.com. I had borrowed this set from a friend and couldn't complete it because I had broken my hand and gave it back to her, so I knew what the real set should look like. What I received was thinner, smaller books (with I believe all of the right info, though) and the DVD case itself was thin paper, unlike the sturdy original which doesn't bend at all. The DVD's themselves appeared as if there were oil stains or other markings on them, no scratches, but they would skip throughout and just stop one of them does not work AT ALL- right out of the box! Also, the beginning of the real P90X gives you the option of playing it with Tony Horton rambling throughout, and a version where you can mute him except for the important parts. These DVD's were so poorly done that it APPEARS to have this option, however you can only select the first one, and if you've done these before, you know Tony can get pretty old, pretty fast.That being said, overall I love P90X, but shouldn't have been so darn cheap in the first place. I would have sent this right back, however I didn't even know it was a scam until it was too late. I opened the package much after I had spent the time and money to  build my workout station. Guess that cheap price truly is too good to be true. The cd's seem cheap and skip we are happy with the workouts but not happy with the cd's .  The cd starts out good but then starts skipping.  You can just keep watching and it will start working but you miss part of the workout. Did not get half way through the 90days before DVDs started skipping and some quit playing all together. I tried to call customer service and received no help. Wouldn't buy it again or recommend the Dvd's to anyone. Downloading the workouts from internet is the only way to ensure the best quality over time.
