I want to rate this higher because it is a good workout. Unfortunately I've run across a DVD that doesn't work properly. I've not gotten through all of them to see if there are others. While one DVD might not seem that bad, it means there is a workout in this program that I cannot do. Amazon has been good in the past about exchanges, but it doesn't look like they are accepting this product for exchange now due to multiple complaints on it. I hate to return it because I enjoy the workouts. It has left me in a bad position since I purchased this on sale and wouldn't be able to replace it for the same price. As it is, I will just have to leave a poor review for the DVD quality. The program itself is good. As someone who came to it COMPLETELY out of shape it is difficult. But, provided I do the exercises using the modified steps recommended in the videos I've been able to keep up no problem.However, I have suffered the same bad DVD quality that others have complained about and, yes, it is nearly impossible to correct; here's the chat I just had with amazon. I have now emailed Beachbody in hopes of better results.Antony:Thanks so much for waiting.I've checked your order and see it was placed with Beachbody, a seller on our website.Because Beachbody's inventory is constantly changing, we can't replace items sold by them that are Fulfilled by Amazon.Instead you're welcome to return this DVD for refund.If you prefer, I'll provide the free return shipping label to return this DVD.You're welcome to place a new order for this DVD also.Me:Can I return the single DVD or is it returning the whole set?Antony:Please return the whole set.Unfortunately we aren't able to replace the defective disc as this order is placed with a seller on our website.If you prefer, I'll provide the free return shipping label to return this DVD.Me:I'm not sure I want to return the whole set for one disc with the risk that another shipment is also damaged. I will consider my options but thank you for your time.Update: I contacted Beachbody directly; they replaced the (single) DVD with no fuss or hassle - didn't have to return the whole set. It's great to see a company that will stand by their product and quickly and easily resolve issues even when using 3rd party purchasing mediums like amazon. =D The package that holds the DVD discs is not suitable for storing the optical media. It is made out of papers and causes scratches on the discs, and the discs will become unreadable after some use.I purchased mine from Beachbody fulfilled by Amazon.com. Out of 13 DVD's that I received, one disc was failing from the beginning. Another disc soon became the same after using a couple of times in and out of the designated DVD holder.If you are going to purchase this product, first thing you will need to do is to check all DVD's are readable. And next thing you need to do is getting a safe CD binder and storing the DVD's there.Please take a look at other 1-star or 2-star reviews, and see what their complaints are about - Damaged DVD's!!!The workout itself looks great, but it requires extra equipments such as pull-up bar and workout bands. If you have them already it's great. Otherwise, you will need to spend just little more money. Ok i just started the workout and i love it, its very hard at first but i just keep pushin my self. The reason for only 2 stars is because the dvd's suck.  I got the cardiox out and tried to use it for the first time and it was skipping bad.  For as much as you pay for the program they should atleast make sure the material last the whole 90 days.  so think about your pick. Great program. Five star and everything. But for $130 + The product should be packaged better, mine came with a couple DVDs scratched straight out of the box. I took great cares of my cd/dvd and I don't see this product last through the entire 90 days.I had to take breaks during workout due to the DVD reading error or pause completely. For one of the disk I had to skip 3 min just to keep the program running.I did/would "Bring it" everyday, but unfortunately, in this particular case...The DVD wasn't able to "bring it". Leg and back DVD does not work. All the rest of the dvds work. I was so excited to get this. I started as soon as I got the dvds. The routine works, I have friends and family that have done multiple rounds with great results.That said, Beachbody customer service left me feeling very poorly about my purchase. They were absolutely zero help when inquiring about the defective DVD.Ultimately, long story short, I have to return the entire set back to Amazon, and instead of it being replaced, I will be given a full refund, and I can purchase a new set(hope that none of those dvds are defective).Biggest problem is, I have already started my 90 days. I am motivated to continue with the routine I have gotten myself into. Having to ship it back and wait for a new order to come, puts me at least two weeks away from my routine. I personally feel that's unacceptable.I'm sure I could find a pirated version of that DVD, but given the success of my friends and family, I really wanted to support P90x.I don't think that my problem is a "normal" occurrence, but hopefully people will understand from this review that if you do have an issue with the actual dvds, you're left making a hard decision to stop your routine and wait, like I am for a new set, or just returning it all together and finding a different program that has superior customer service. I love the program itself. It's amazing, which is why I wanted another set of DVDs as a backup to the one I already have. I just now opened the box, all these months later, to discover that the packaging and the DVD menus are all in Spanish. I know enough Spanish to recognize that "PECHO Y ESPALDA" are "CHEST AND BACK" but I would prefer English. While playing the DVD, the default is Spanish, but you can choose "INGLES NORMAL" from the menu and get "normal English." Poor quality control. The first DVD would not play in a Bose Home System, portable DVD player or PC. Contacted their customer service. They refused to replace that DVD. Told me we had to contact Amazon. In the end, it was a good thing, because after running through every DVD most have issues. Only the first one would not play, the others had sound, but not video in parts.Returning and reordering, only because my husband wants this. If the second set is as bad, that will go back with no reorder.Beachbody, if you are going to charge this much money for this product, please review your quality control.What we were able to see, my husband likes--thus the two stars. This program is not for everyone.  I think I would have perhaps enjoyed knowing a little bit more about it prior to my purchase.  This is not a good starter program for getting in shape, but it rather for those farther along in their training.  My experience with the seller (it did not come directly from Amazon) was also a little off-putting. Well I was quite enjoying the workouts and I got to the kenpo disc...which up until halfway through, was my favorite disc. And then it started freezing and skipping. The problem is that I bought it on the deal of the day. I can return it and get a refund, but no option for a replacement. If I buy it again, I'd be paying full price. And there's no option to contact the seller either. Way to abandon the consumer beach body. All I want is a replacement to this single disc.  I want to rate this higher because it is a good workout.

They were absolutely zero help when inquiring about the defective DVD.Ultimately, long story short, I have to return the entire set back to Amazon, and instead of it being replaced, I will be given a full refund, and I can purchase a new set(hope that none of those dvds are defective).Biggest problem is, I have already started my 90 days. I am motivated to continue with the routine I have gotten myself into. Having to ship it back and wait for a new order to come, puts me at least two weeks away from my routine. I personally feel that's unacceptable.I'm sure I could find a pirated version of that DVD, but given the success of my friends and family, I really wanted to support P90x.I don't think that my problem is a "normal" occurrence, but hopefully people will understand from this review that if you do have an issue with the actual dvds, you're left making a hard decision to stop your routine and wait, like I am for a new set, or just returning it all together and finding a different program that has superior customer service. I love the program itself. It's amazing, which is why I wanted another set of DVDs as a backup to the one I already have. I just now opened the box, all these months later, to discover that the packaging and the DVD menus are all in Spanish. I know enough Spanish to recognize that "PECHO Y ESPALDA" are "CHEST AND BACK" but I would prefer English. While playing the DVD, the default is Spanish, but you can choose "INGLES NORMAL" from the menu and get "normal English." Poor quality control. The first DVD would not play in a Bose Home System, portable DVD player or PC. Contacted their customer service. They refused to replace that DVD. Told me we had to contact Amazon. In the end, it was a good thing, because after running through every DVD most have issues. Only the first one would not play, the others had sound, but not video in parts.Returning and reordering, only because my husband wants this. If the second set is as bad, that will go back with no reorder.Beachbody, if you are going to charge this much money for this product, please review your quality control.What we were able to see, my husband likes--thus the two stars. This program is not for everyone.  I think I would have perhaps enjoyed knowing a little bit more about it prior to my purchase.  This is not a good starter program for getting in shape, but it rather for those farther along in their training.  My experience with the seller (it did not come directly from Amazon) was also a little off-putting. Well I was quite enjoying the workouts and I got to the kenpo disc...which up until halfway through, was my favorite disc. And then it started freezing and skipping. The problem is that I bought it on the deal of the day. I can return it and get a refund, but no option for a replacement. If I buy it again, I'd be paying full price. And there's no option to contact the seller either. Way to abandon the consumer beach body. All I want is a replacement to this single disc.  I want to rate this higher because it is a good workout. Unfortunately I've run across a DVD that doesn't work properly. I've not gotten through all of them to see if there are others. While one DVD might not seem that bad, it means there is a workout in this program that I cannot do. Amazon has been good in the past about exchanges, but it doesn't look like they are accepting this product for exchange now due to multiple complaints on it. I hate to return it because I enjoy the workouts. It has left me in a bad position since I purchased this on sale and wouldn't be able to replace it for the same price. As it is, I will just have to leave a poor review for the DVD quality. The program itself is good. As someone who came to it COMPLETELY out of shape it is difficult. But, provided I do the exercises using the modified steps recommended in the videos I've been able to keep up no problem.However, I have suffered the same bad DVD quality that others have complained about and, yes, it is nearly impossible to correct; here's the chat I just had with amazon. I have now emailed Beachbody in hopes of better results.Antony:Thanks so much for waiting.I've checked your order and see it was placed with Beachbody, a seller on our website.Because Beachbody's inventory is constantly changing, we can't replace items sold by them that are Fulfilled by Amazon.Instead you're welcome to return this DVD for refund.If you prefer, I'll provide the free return shipping label to return this DVD.You're welcome to place a new order for this DVD also.Me:Can I return the single DVD or is it returning the whole set?Antony:Please return the whole set.Unfortunately we aren't able to replace the defective disc as this order is placed with a seller on our website.If you prefer, I'll provide the free return shipping label to return this DVD.Me:I'm not sure I want to return the whole set for one disc with the risk that another shipment is also damaged. I will consider my options but thank you for your time.Update: I contacted Beachbody directly; they replaced the (single) DVD with no fuss or hassle - didn't have to return the whole set. It's great to see a company that will stand by their product and quickly and easily resolve issues even when using 3rd party purchasing mediums like amazon. =D The package that holds the DVD discs is not suitable for storing the optical media. It is made out of papers and causes scratches on the discs, and the discs will become unreadable after some use.I purchased mine from Beachbody fulfilled by Amazon.com. Out of 13 DVD's that I received, one disc was failing from the beginning. Another disc soon became the same after using a couple of times in and out of the designated DVD holder.If you are going to purchase this product, first thing you will need to do is to check all DVD's are readable. And next thing you need to do is getting a safe CD binder and storing the DVD's there.Please take a look at other 1-star or 2-star reviews, and see what their complaints are about - Damaged DVD's!!!The workout itself looks great, but it requires extra equipments such as pull-up bar and workout bands. If you have them already it's great. Otherwise, you will need to spend just little more money. Ok i just started the workout and i love it, its very hard at first but i just keep pushin my self. The reason for only 2 stars is because the dvd's suck.  I got the cardiox out and tried to use it for the first time and it was skipping bad.  For as much as you pay for the program they should atleast make sure the material last the whole 90 days.  so think about your pick. Great program. Five star and everything. But for $130 + The product should be packaged better, mine came with a couple DVDs scratched straight out of the box. I took great cares of my cd/dvd and I don't see this product last through the entire 90 days.I had to take breaks during workout due to the DVD reading error or pause completely. For one of the disk I had to skip 3 min just to keep the program running.I did/would "Bring it" everyday, but unfortunately, in this particular case...The DVD wasn't able to "bring it".

I have now emailed Beachbody in hopes of better results.Antony:Thanks so much for waiting.I've checked your order and see it was placed with Beachbody, a seller on our website.Because Beachbody's inventory is constantly changing, we can't replace items sold by them that are Fulfilled by Amazon.Instead you're welcome to return this DVD for refund.If you prefer, I'll provide the free return shipping label to return this DVD.You're welcome to place a new order for this DVD also.Me:Can I return the single DVD or is it returning the whole set?Antony:Please return the whole set.Unfortunately we aren't able to replace the defective disc as this order is placed with a seller on our website.If you prefer, I'll provide the free return shipping label to return this DVD.Me:I'm not sure I want to return the whole set for one disc with the risk that another shipment is also damaged. I will consider my options but thank you for your time.Update: I contacted Beachbody directly; they replaced the (single) DVD with no fuss or hassle - didn't have to return the whole set. It's great to see a company that will stand by their product and quickly and easily resolve issues even when using 3rd party purchasing mediums like amazon. =D The package that holds the DVD discs is not suitable for storing the optical media. It is made out of papers and causes scratches on the discs, and the discs will become unreadable after some use.I purchased mine from Beachbody fulfilled by Amazon.com. Out of 13 DVD's that I received, one disc was failing from the beginning. Another disc soon became the same after using a couple of times in and out of the designated DVD holder.If you are going to purchase this product, first thing you will need to do is to check all DVD's are readable. And next thing you need to do is getting a safe CD binder and storing the DVD's there.Please take a look at other 1-star or 2-star reviews, and see what their complaints are about - Damaged DVD's!!!The workout itself looks great, but it requires extra equipments such as pull-up bar and workout bands. If you have them already it's great. Otherwise, you will need to spend just little more money. Ok i just started the workout and i love it, its very hard at first but i just keep pushin my self. The reason for only 2 stars is because the dvd's suck.  I got the cardiox out and tried to use it for the first time and it was skipping bad.  For as much as you pay for the program they should atleast make sure the material last the whole 90 days.  so think about your pick. Great program. Five star and everything. But for $130 + The product should be packaged better, mine came with a couple DVDs scratched straight out of the box. I took great cares of my cd/dvd and I don't see this product last through the entire 90 days.I had to take breaks during workout due to the DVD reading error or pause completely. For one of the disk I had to skip 3 min just to keep the program running.I did/would "Bring it" everyday, but unfortunately, in this particular case...The DVD wasn't able to "bring it". Leg and back DVD does not work. All the rest of the dvds work. I was so excited to get this. I started as soon as I got the dvds. The routine works, I have friends and family that have done multiple rounds with great results.That said, Beachbody customer service left me feeling very poorly about my purchase. They were absolutely zero help when inquiring about the defective DVD.Ultimately, long story short, I have to return the entire set back to Amazon, and instead of it being replaced, I will be given a full refund, and I can purchase a new set(hope that none of those dvds are defective).Biggest problem is, I have already started my 90 days. I am motivated to continue with the routine I have gotten myself into. Having to ship it back and wait for a new order to come, puts me at least two weeks away from my routine. I personally feel that's unacceptable.I'm sure I could find a pirated version of that DVD, but given the success of my friends and family, I really wanted to support P90x.I don't think that my problem is a "normal" occurrence, but hopefully people will understand from this review that if you do have an issue with the actual dvds, you're left making a hard decision to stop your routine and wait, like I am for a new set, or just returning it all together and finding a different program that has superior customer service. I love the program itself. It's amazing, which is why I wanted another set of DVDs as a backup to the one I already have. I just now opened the box, all these months later, to discover that the packaging and the DVD menus are all in Spanish. I know enough Spanish to recognize that "PECHO Y ESPALDA" are "CHEST AND BACK" but I would prefer English. While playing the DVD, the default is Spanish, but you can choose "INGLES NORMAL" from the menu and get "normal English." Poor quality control. The first DVD would not play in a Bose Home System, portable DVD player or PC. Contacted their customer service. They refused to replace that DVD. Told me we had to contact Amazon. In the end, it was a good thing, because after running through every DVD most have issues. Only the first one would not play, the others had sound, but not video in parts.Returning and reordering, only because my husband wants this. If the second set is as bad, that will go back with no reorder.Beachbody, if you are going to charge this much money for this product, please review your quality control.What we were able to see, my husband likes--thus the two stars. This program is not for everyone.  I think I would have perhaps enjoyed knowing a little bit more about it prior to my purchase.  This is not a good starter program for getting in shape, but it rather for those farther along in their training.  My experience with the seller (it did not come directly from Amazon) was also a little off-putting. Well I was quite enjoying the workouts and I got to the kenpo disc...which up until halfway through, was my favorite disc. And then it started freezing and skipping. The problem is that I bought it on the deal of the day. I can return it and get a refund, but no option for a replacement. If I buy it again, I'd be paying full price. And there's no option to contact the seller either. Way to abandon the consumer beach body. All I want is a replacement to this single disc.  I want to rate this higher because it is a good workout. Unfortunately I've run across a DVD that doesn't work properly. I've not gotten through all of them to see if there are others. While one DVD might not seem that bad, it means there is a workout in this program that I cannot do. Amazon has been good in the past about exchanges, but it doesn't look like they are accepting this product for exchange now due to multiple complaints on it. I hate to return it because I enjoy the workouts. It has left me in a bad position since I purchased this on sale and wouldn't be able to replace it for the same price.

I personally feel that's unacceptable.I'm sure I could find a pirated version of that DVD, but given the success of my friends and family, I really wanted to support P90x.I don't think that my problem is a "normal" occurrence, but hopefully people will understand from this review that if you do have an issue with the actual dvds, you're left making a hard decision to stop your routine and wait, like I am for a new set, or just returning it all together and finding a different program that has superior customer service. I love the program itself. It's amazing, which is why I wanted another set of DVDs as a backup to the one I already have. I just now opened the box, all these months later, to discover that the packaging and the DVD menus are all in Spanish. I know enough Spanish to recognize that "PECHO Y ESPALDA" are "CHEST AND BACK" but I would prefer English. While playing the DVD, the default is Spanish, but you can choose "INGLES NORMAL" from the menu and get "normal English." Poor quality control. The first DVD would not play in a Bose Home System, portable DVD player or PC. Contacted their customer service. They refused to replace that DVD. Told me we had to contact Amazon. In the end, it was a good thing, because after running through every DVD most have issues. Only the first one would not play, the others had sound, but not video in parts.Returning and reordering, only because my husband wants this. If the second set is as bad, that will go back with no reorder.Beachbody, if you are going to charge this much money for this product, please review your quality control.What we were able to see, my husband likes--thus the two stars. This program is not for everyone.  I think I would have perhaps enjoyed knowing a little bit more about it prior to my purchase.  This is not a good starter program for getting in shape, but it rather for those farther along in their training.  My experience with the seller (it did not come directly from Amazon) was also a little off-putting. Well I was quite enjoying the workouts and I got to the kenpo disc...which up until halfway through, was my favorite disc. And then it started freezing and skipping. The problem is that I bought it on the deal of the day. I can return it and get a refund, but no option for a replacement. If I buy it again, I'd be paying full price. And there's no option to contact the seller either. Way to abandon the consumer beach body. All I want is a replacement to this single disc.  I want to rate this higher because it is a good workout. Unfortunately I've run across a DVD that doesn't work properly. I've not gotten through all of them to see if there are others. While one DVD might not seem that bad, it means there is a workout in this program that I cannot do. Amazon has been good in the past about exchanges, but it doesn't look like they are accepting this product for exchange now due to multiple complaints on it. I hate to return it because I enjoy the workouts. It has left me in a bad position since I purchased this on sale and wouldn't be able to replace it for the same price. As it is, I will just have to leave a poor review for the DVD quality. The program itself is good. As someone who came to it COMPLETELY out of shape it is difficult. But, provided I do the exercises using the modified steps recommended in the videos I've been able to keep up no problem.However, I have suffered the same bad DVD quality that others have complained about and, yes, it is nearly impossible to correct; here's the chat I just had with amazon. I have now emailed Beachbody in hopes of better results.Antony:Thanks so much for waiting.I've checked your order and see it was placed with Beachbody, a seller on our website.Because Beachbody's inventory is constantly changing, we can't replace items sold by them that are Fulfilled by Amazon.Instead you're welcome to return this DVD for refund.If you prefer, I'll provide the free return shipping label to return this DVD.You're welcome to place a new order for this DVD also.Me:Can I return the single DVD or is it returning the whole set?Antony:Please return the whole set.Unfortunately we aren't able to replace the defective disc as this order is placed with a seller on our website.If you prefer, I'll provide the free return shipping label to return this DVD.Me:I'm not sure I want to return the whole set for one disc with the risk that another shipment is also damaged. I will consider my options but thank you for your time.Update: I contacted Beachbody directly; they replaced the (single) DVD with no fuss or hassle - didn't have to return the whole set. It's great to see a company that will stand by their product and quickly and easily resolve issues even when using 3rd party purchasing mediums like amazon. =D The package that holds the DVD discs is not suitable for storing the optical media. It is made out of papers and causes scratches on the discs, and the discs will become unreadable after some use.I purchased mine from Beachbody fulfilled by Amazon.com. Out of 13 DVD's that I received, one disc was failing from the beginning. Another disc soon became the same after using a couple of times in and out of the designated DVD holder.If you are going to purchase this product, first thing you will need to do is to check all DVD's are readable. And next thing you need to do is getting a safe CD binder and storing the DVD's there.Please take a look at other 1-star or 2-star reviews, and see what their complaints are about - Damaged DVD's!!!The workout itself looks great, but it requires extra equipments such as pull-up bar and workout bands. If you have them already it's great. Otherwise, you will need to spend just little more money. Ok i just started the workout and i love it, its very hard at first but i just keep pushin my self. The reason for only 2 stars is because the dvd's suck.  I got the cardiox out and tried to use it for the first time and it was skipping bad.  For as much as you pay for the program they should atleast make sure the material last the whole 90 days.  so think about your pick. Great program. Five star and everything. But for $130 + The product should be packaged better, mine came with a couple DVDs scratched straight out of the box. I took great cares of my cd/dvd and I don't see this product last through the entire 90 days.I had to take breaks during workout due to the DVD reading error or pause completely. For one of the disk I had to skip 3 min just to keep the program running.I did/would "Bring it" everyday, but unfortunately, in this particular case...The DVD wasn't able to "bring it". Leg and back DVD does not work. All the rest of the dvds work. I was so excited to get this. I started as soon as I got the dvds. The routine works, I have friends and family that have done multiple rounds with great results.That said, Beachbody customer service left me feeling very poorly about my purchase. They were absolutely zero help when inquiring about the defective DVD.Ultimately, long story short, I have to return the entire set back to Amazon, and instead of it being replaced, I will be given a full refund, and I can purchase a new set(hope that none of those dvds are defective).Biggest problem is, I have already started my 90 days.

I have now emailed Beachbody in hopes of better results.Antony:Thanks so much for waiting.I've checked your order and see it was placed with Beachbody, a seller on our website.Because Beachbody's inventory is constantly changing, we can't replace items sold by them that are Fulfilled by Amazon.Instead you're welcome to return this DVD for refund.If you prefer, I'll provide the free return shipping label to return this DVD.You're welcome to place a new order for this DVD also.Me:Can I return the single DVD or is it returning the whole set?Antony:Please return the whole set.Unfortunately we aren't able to replace the defective disc as this order is placed with a seller on our website.If you prefer, I'll provide the free return shipping label to return this DVD.Me:I'm not sure I want to return the whole set for one disc with the risk that another shipment is also damaged. I will consider my options but thank you for your time.Update: I contacted Beachbody directly; they replaced the (single) DVD with no fuss or hassle - didn't have to return the whole set. It's great to see a company that will stand by their product and quickly and easily resolve issues even when using 3rd party purchasing mediums like amazon. =D The package that holds the DVD discs is not suitable for storing the optical media. It is made out of papers and causes scratches on the discs, and the discs will become unreadable after some use.I purchased mine from Beachbody fulfilled by Amazon.com. Out of 13 DVD's that I received, one disc was failing from the beginning. Another disc soon became the same after using a couple of times in and out of the designated DVD holder.If you are going to purchase this product, first thing you will need to do is to check all DVD's are readable. And next thing you need to do is getting a safe CD binder and storing the DVD's there.Please take a look at other 1-star or 2-star reviews, and see what their complaints are about - Damaged DVD's!!!The workout itself looks great, but it requires extra equipments such as pull-up bar and workout bands. If you have them already it's great. Otherwise, you will need to spend just little more money. Ok i just started the workout and i love it, its very hard at first but i just keep pushin my self. The reason for only 2 stars is because the dvd's suck.  I got the cardiox out and tried to use it for the first time and it was skipping bad.  For as much as you pay for the program they should atleast make sure the material last the whole 90 days.  so think about your pick. Great program. Five star and everything. But for $130 + The product should be packaged better, mine came with a couple DVDs scratched straight out of the box. I took great cares of my cd/dvd and I don't see this product last through the entire 90 days.I had to take breaks during workout due to the DVD reading error or pause completely. For one of the disk I had to skip 3 min just to keep the program running.I did/would "Bring it" everyday, but unfortunately, in this particular case...The DVD wasn't able to "bring it". Leg and back DVD does not work. All the rest of the dvds work. I was so excited to get this. I started as soon as I got the dvds. The routine works, I have friends and family that have done multiple rounds with great results.That said, Beachbody customer service left me feeling very poorly about my purchase. They were absolutely zero help when inquiring about the defective DVD.Ultimately, long story short, I have to return the entire set back to Amazon, and instead of it being replaced, I will be given a full refund, and I can purchase a new set(hope that none of those dvds are defective).Biggest problem is, I have already started my 90 days. I am motivated to continue with the routine I have gotten myself into. Having to ship it back and wait for a new order to come, puts me at least two weeks away from my routine. I personally feel that's unacceptable.I'm sure I could find a pirated version of that DVD, but given the success of my friends and family, I really wanted to support P90x.I don't think that my problem is a "normal" occurrence, but hopefully people will understand from this review that if you do have an issue with the actual dvds, you're left making a hard decision to stop your routine and wait, like I am for a new set, or just returning it all together and finding a different program that has superior customer service. I love the program itself. It's amazing, which is why I wanted another set of DVDs as a backup to the one I already have. I just now opened the box, all these months later, to discover that the packaging and the DVD menus are all in Spanish. I know enough Spanish to recognize that "PECHO Y ESPALDA" are "CHEST AND BACK" but I would prefer English. While playing the DVD, the default is Spanish, but you can choose "INGLES NORMAL" from the menu and get "normal English." Poor quality control. The first DVD would not play in a Bose Home System, portable DVD player or PC. Contacted their customer service. They refused to replace that DVD. Told me we had to contact Amazon. In the end, it was a good thing, because after running through every DVD most have issues. Only the first one would not play, the others had sound, but not video in parts.Returning and reordering, only because my husband wants this. If the second set is as bad, that will go back with no reorder.Beachbody, if you are going to charge this much money for this product, please review your quality control.What we were able to see, my husband likes--thus the two stars. This program is not for everyone.  I think I would have perhaps enjoyed knowing a little bit more about it prior to my purchase.  This is not a good starter program for getting in shape, but it rather for those farther along in their training.  My experience with the seller (it did not come directly from Amazon) was also a little off-putting. Well I was quite enjoying the workouts and I got to the kenpo disc...which up until halfway through, was my favorite disc. And then it started freezing and skipping. The problem is that I bought it on the deal of the day. I can return it and get a refund, but no option for a replacement. If I buy it again, I'd be paying full price. And there's no option to contact the seller either. Way to abandon the consumer beach body. All I want is a replacement to this single disc.  I want to rate this higher because it is a good workout. Unfortunately I've run across a DVD that doesn't work properly. I've not gotten through all of them to see if there are others. While one DVD might not seem that bad, it means there is a workout in this program that I cannot do. Amazon has been good in the past about exchanges, but it doesn't look like they are accepting this product for exchange now due to multiple complaints on it. I hate to return it because I enjoy the workouts. It has left me in a bad position since I purchased this on sale and wouldn't be able to replace it for the same price. As it is, I will just have to leave a poor review for the DVD quality. The program itself is good. As someone who came to it COMPLETELY out of shape it is difficult.
