Had you heard of MTV? So if someone had mentioned the Rolling Stones, or U2, or other rock bands, you would not have recognized those names? You actually prayed to God about this? The night at the bar, though, Billy wasn't really thinking about any of that. He just spotted Chaim and introduced himself. So then you began performing pretty regularly with him? Did he get a reputation? Did people find out about him? Was it satisfying? This is the first you'd spoken to her? Now wait a second, wait a second. Let's back up. It was that quick? But you knew that you were killing Curly Oxide at that moment you agreed to get married? Were you sad that that show's going to be over? Were you relieved? Because non-Hasidics are not allowed at the wedding? Does your wife know that you had this other life as Curly Oxide. Yes, she actually does. I told him. I actually regret telling it. Because let me tell you, if don't know if you guys are married. But anybody that is married, do not tell you wife your past, especially your troubled past, I mean the stuff that you did, your mischief past.  Was that good, were you pleased with that?  How far do you have to be able to drive the car?  Did that not seem slightly insane at the time, to build a car stereo so loud that in order to sit in the car and play it, you had to have ear plugs and earmuffs?  It must have dawned on you at that moment, or was it before, that this was a cultural phenomenon? Just off the charts.  So you were up there for, what, how long do you think? Two minutes or something like that?  Did you have a sense at the time that it had gone well or gone poorly? So in a sense, this trial kind of snapped you out of it, the substance of it began to matter more. I hear ringing. Jello Biafra is on the line with me.  Did you guys ever get a chance to talk? Let me get us back to our subject. Can I interrupt you and just say it's kind of hard to imagine that you guys ever were adversaries. Jello? Would you like to share?
