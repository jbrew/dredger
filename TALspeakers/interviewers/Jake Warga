Let's talk about you. You were going to go to the hospital today, right? 6:00 PM? They waited so long? Do you think it would have worked? Were you hoping to find similarities between your mom's report and your report? What were you doing there? Same cocktail? But it didn't work before. A few blocks? I guess that's pretty [INAUDIBLE]. Do you think you found the only way to cope? What's your relationship with death? Fear of living? It'll catch up. Well, train's here. No pennies. Do you ever cry? We're in the last nine minutes of this cassette. I want it to be over now.  So you believe in ghosts?  What are you doing here?  I mean, I can handle a chipmunk. But seeing a body? I mean this is so Blair Witch. We are tromping through the woods.  I'm not very graceful.  3:00 AM. Yeah.  Oh god. Kendra, how'd you think it went last night?  I don't know. But I mean the stuff on the video was pretty weird. Haunted, I don't know. What do you think? What do you think that whole thing at 3:00 AM was when the door opened?  It felt like the wind to me. But not like, that's a ghost.
