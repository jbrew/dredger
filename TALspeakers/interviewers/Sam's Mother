 OK. So let me start interviewing you.  Can you describe yourself? What kind of a person are you?  You're kindful?  What do you do that's nice?  What were you like when you were three years old?  Do you want to talk about what you used to be like?  I want to show you a drawing that you did.  There's about 100 hearts in your face in this drawing.  Green hearts, how come? What were you feeling when you drew this?  All your drawings now have a lot of hearts and flowers and birds, and people are smiling. Do you remember, when you were about four years old, do you remember what you drew all the time?  Black holes?  Do you know what you were feeling when you were drawing black holes every day?  Yeah. Did you feel like that a lot, like everybody was going to die?  What are some nightmares you've had?  The moon blows on you? How come?  You had bad thoughts and that's why the moon blew on you?  Did the moon know you had bad thoughts?  What would happen when the moon blew on you?  And you had that nightmare a lot, I think.  No. Like a whole year you had that nightmare.  Do you know why you take the pills every day?  What is that? Nobody can see on the recorder. Describe it.  Pumping blood all wild?  Do you have any girlfriends?  Aw. Tell me about Rose.  What does she look like?  [LAUGHS]  Would you like to be married?  What is marrying like?  Let's make up a story about a bad boy. Sure.  That would scare people listening?  Let's make up a story about a human boy. What would he do in the day? Push his bowl of food away and spill it?  What else?  What would the boy be thinking?
