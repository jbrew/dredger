 For a Christmas present, would you like a new pressure cooker?  What about a sweater?  What about some jewelry?  I didn't know that.  I heard-- I don't know who told me, but-- you're not giving gifts this year, right? You, yourself.  Is that what you think it's for?  Really?  You think we're seeking approval?  It's a bit late.  It's really horrible.  You asked her for argyle socks?  I like the hand-knit socks. Well, I'm sure you do.  And how do you think the singing is going to sound?  Putrid?  Really? I've had this impression that we sound great singing the harmonies.  Was it hideous? Does it sound bad?  Eric Hanbury?  All right. [SINGING] There is no gas station over here. --[SINGING] to get into it. Would let me go ahead? Thank you very much. What a nice guy. OK, wait. Where's the doorbell?  How will they know? OK. Ready? Wait. OK. Ready?  Shall we come in? Can we come in? It's freezing outside. Can we come in?  What's that?  Don't bring your germs in here. That's nice. All right, here we go.  This is your Christmas present.  And? You're implying that we're not like that anymore? Yes, that would be nice. Yes, a cup of tea. So how does that compare with other presents we've given you?  What's the best present we've ever given you? What? Help?  Re-paper the house?  Oh my God. Where did you get that?  For how long? That's a cashmere scarf. I gave you that for Christmas last year. And you left it here? You haven't even-- why do I bother?  Yeah.  It's your Christmas present.  You don't want to hear "Blest Are The Pure in Heart"?  You're missing your TV program.  Yes, lovely to see you. What's the name of the program?  Pie in the Sky. Goodbye. See you, Dad. Goodbye, Ma. Love you.
