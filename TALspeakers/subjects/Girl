Man, I hate this Shakespeare stuff. Are you having a hard time with that? I don't know-- Yeah, I'm a Christian now. That's why I'm so happy. Yes. Yes, I believe in God. I should have gotten away from you the second that you started drinking. This is all your fault. [INAUDIBLE]. School shooting. Yeah, school shooting's the best. No, it's not. It's the rave. The rave scene's the best, because you get to dance. I'm Jessica. Whoo. I had a great time with all of my suicide girls. I got to act with every single one of you almost every night. First of all, I would kill Arafat. And we are not the ones who have to suffer. This is our country. We don't have to give it up for them. If they want to live with us, they have to accept our conditions. We don't have to be suckers, and like, get down on our knees for us. Because the fact is that before this whole peace agreement started, they were afraid of us. OK? They were afraid of us. No one threw stones. Everyone was afraid to walk in the street. And since this started, you know, we give them, like you know, there's a saying. You're give them one finger and they want the whole hand. Israel shouldn't give up one inch of territory. This is our country. We fought for it. We won. That's it! You know? Stop being babies. Or do you want New York to be given back to the English or something? You know? It's stupid. I hate the people who want to kill me, yes. If there's one single person in [UNINTELLIGIBLE] and Ramallah, which I highly doubt there is. But if there's one single person there who is truly pro-Israel and pro-Jewish, then sure, I have nothing against them. But the fact is that the majority of all these people, they're murderers, you know? How come you're going back? [INAUDIBLE] Really? Wow! That's cool. That's a pretty good summary. I get mad at my parents sometimes when they say it, because I have two younger siblings. And I think that it's just better if, for little kids, they don't learn it when they're younger. I think that around when you get in, maybe, third grade or fourth grade, that's a good age to actually know what the words mean. Because you're smarter. I think I used the first curse word when I was eight, because someone got me real mad and I was in an argument with my friend. And then I was like, you F-in' B, why don't you get out of my F-in' face? Well, sort of, I felt relieved, because she actually listened to me. She actually got out of my face. Yeah, I think he was just really happy and wanted to express his feelings.  She runs a day care. And then she had said go upstairs before I bust your S-H. Then-- Yeah, because some people are really offended. There's a lot of people out there who take that really, really, really strongly.  Concert? Some people in this room would like to know if you have a girlfriend, and how old you are.  Do you guys live together?  Did you guys read and go to libraries when you were teens?  Why isn't the drummer wearing any shoe laces? It's his phone. 823--
