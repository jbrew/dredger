I was feeling like hugging you and kissing you and giving you cards. What?  Yeah.  Like, the black hole was going to suck the whole world up and make everybody die and end of the world.  Yeah.  The moon, blowing moon.  Yeah.  I think of bad thoughts that time. I mean, bad thoughts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was scared and frightening.  Two times.  Because my brain is all, like that.  It's so wild. And has to-- it's pumping blood all wild. Yeah.  Yeah, only one. Who is it? Rose.  She's kind and cute.  I forget.  She looks kind of like her mom, maybe.  Yeah! I would like to be.  You have a bride. And you are giving them flowers and heart and Valentines stuff.  [UNINTELLIGIBLE] boy?  No. That'd scare people out.  Yeah.  He would just have fits.

That bad boy turned out to be a good boy. Do you know anyone like that?  No. It's fake.
