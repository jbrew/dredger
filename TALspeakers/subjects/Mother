 Johnny, put that away, come on. Yes. Don't give me a close-up because my eyes are too ugly for close-ups.  [SINGING]  No, go use toilet paper. [SINGING] Steve and Lisa's brother-in-law's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. [SINGING] I'm dreaming of a white Christmas-- [SINGING] --just like the ones we used to know. Bye-bye sweetheart. I brush it, and I put in big, big rollers.  OK, why don't you guys all get next to Daddy? It's probably not good for me to be out in the dark, is it?  It's 1.1 miles. It was so incredible looking in the mirror when his head was born. Then, all of a sudden, Kyle Junior was in my arms.  No, no. I've got a pressure cooker.  I've got at least 20 sweaters.  I have more jewelry than I shall never wear. I don't like jewelry.  Well, that's the truth.  Thank you very much. That was very nice. Don't breathe your germs on me.  Don't bring your germs in here.  Thank you very much. That was very nice. Reminded me of when you were nice boys who went to school and sang in the choir.  I don't know. You don't even come to see me unless you want something, so. Do you want a cup of tea?  Very nice. Very exceptional. Thank you very much.  I'd ask for help.  Do you know what I would really like? I would like you all to come in the spring, help me clean up the garden, help me clean up the house, re-paper the house. That would be lovely.  Re-paper.  The living room, the bath, anywhere.  It's been up in the cupboard.  No, I haven't got time.  Go in there and do it.  That's enough. You've done enough.  Very nice. Thank you both very much indeed.  Lovely seeing you.  Pie in the Sky.
