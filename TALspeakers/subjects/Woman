 Who's Sasquatch?  You have a plunger on your head.  Follow me, we'll go to my friends, and we'll all have shots.  I'll throw up.  Hi Starlee.  I remember you. Nice seeing you. That's right. Get to the point. OK. OK. Why not?  Looks good. I don't think I think about it very much of it. When I hear things in the news, yeah, it worries me and all that. But I live my life. My first contact was quite a long time ago, when I first saw Fiddler on the Roof. And it was in the times when we didn't have a VCR at home, so my father would record it on a tape recorder. So I had three hours, and I would listen to that again and again, so that after some time, I knew it by heart. Well, the bottom line was he didn't want to marry me anymore. And I'll never get out of the dress what I put into it. I know I'm not going to get the money, but I would like it to find a good home. I collected this Classic Pooh. You know, Disney has this line of Winnie the Pooh stuff. And he bought me Mickey Mouse. And I'm looking at it, going, "Why did you buy this?" And he said, "Well, they didn't have Classic Pooh." I'm like, "But I don't collect Mickey Mouse." It was just, I don't know. You know me, but you don't care. You can fill it out upstairs, and just give it to me after you're done. You're welcome. Yeah. But you get a lot more affection from the dog than you would a bird and a snake. Oh, I'm sure. They're always waiting for you. They're always happy to see you, no matter what happens. I welcome you to Sun Studios, the birthplace of rock and roll. And if you have any questions, hold them until the end of the tour. And if you have any pagers or cell phones, then turn those off now, because we are entering the year 1950. No way, they're getting a short-sleeve t-shirt? And so, I present a pair of gold and clausinate cuff links with the city seal. Way to go, Sal. Way to come home. Thank you so much for allowing us to be photographed. You make us very proud.  We're not doing any on-the-record interviews in connection with Padilla.  [DIAL TONE] Good morning. Public Affairs.  Obviously, you want to do this to put on the radio, right?  OK. Let me check to see if I might--  --and I'm sorry, I should have done this for you before, but I might be better off-- It's literally like someone lifted something off of you. You walk out feeling like, OK, thank God I know that now. Yes.  [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] We have an investigator, and he investigated the incident. And we also had the pudding tested. They took it to an independent laboratory and tested it. And it was proven that there was no foreign matter in that pudding at all. Now perhaps you weren't told that because I don't think you're told everything. But it was sad that because you thought there was, you incited a riot in the dining room and made a big mess that kids had to clean up that had nothing to do with it.  After the struggle-- Oh! She says buenas tardes. We did it, he's here. Hello, baby. When the jubilees happen, of course, it's still early, early in the morning, and usually still very dark. So you go out in in your little shorty nightgown, and you know, your little babydoll pajamas, because it's so dark. And you're out there, and you're digging, and you're scooping, and all of a sudden, you realize it's broad daylight and you are out there in your pajamas. And then you kind of slink on back to the house and get your clothes on. Hello, baby.  (SINGING) I can tell it's from the heart. How lovely to acquaint you.  (SINGING) I'm aware of your position.  Go, Rusty!  You don't even sit down and do it either.  You told me you [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] manage it.  Because, [UNINTELLIGIBLE], how can I do it until I-- I need to get the first bill to know what I'm working with.  I feel like you do that. I feel like I keep telling you, and you only want to hear what you want to hear. You don't hear the good stuff, like I'm telling you--  I don't believe you. You are really something.  It's not funny.  No, I don't want to wake you up. You don't like to hear my voice. It's just like the tone of your mother's. That makes me feel real good, too. You don't like to talk to me.  What am I supposed to say? "Please, get up, dear. Would you get up?"  Get serious.  I feel kind of like it's dumping on you to discuss--  --your being late.  There isn't much to argue about.  And now I've learned to kind of just expect it and plan around it. Even [UNINTELLIGIBLE] plans around it.  No.  But you see, I think you're just getting back at your mother for all those times she left you swinging on those swings.  Yes, and I think you should grow up and not do that.  I'm not your mother.  See?  These are not fancy shoes. These are old shoes. They're all worn down. Good morning. On behalf of [? Medio ?] Joao Teixeira de Faria, welcome you all to his spiritual center. All belief systems are welcome here. Everybody in this first line, please step back a little bit so that we can form the line. It's about 10 deep right now. All those who have surgery, please raise there hand. I just came-- come on in, I'm sorry about the leaves. I never thought of that. Yeah, I never thought of that. I was. I was. I should have thought of that, and I never did. Thank you very much. I feel much better. I do. I do. Don't have to whisper anymore. He's Walter. He's Walter. He's the ghost that likes to haunt us. I haven't seen Walter, but I've felt him around here. Scary. Yeah, it's like a tingle up your back.  [SPEAKING ARABIC]  [SPEAKING ARABIC]  [SPEAKING ARABIC]  [SPEAKING ARABIC]  [SPEAKING ARABIC]  [SPEAKING ARABIC]  [SPEAKING ARABIC]  Yes.  Yes. Dearest, do you know how much in love with you I am? I have fallen in love without taking a step. Did I trip? Did I stumble? Lose my balance? Graze my knee? Graze my heart? And you watch this, because I'm only going to show you once. Guys. You guys. The bull attacked him. The bull attacked him. What's the address here? And you watch this, because I'm only going to show you once. Them bastards looked at us like we was misfits, and y'all negroes ain't getting in here. You're coming from nowhere. You have nothing. They know you don't have nothing. And then for you to turn around and try to makeshift throw little stepping stones in front of you like that? That's not right. That's not right. Why I'm not staying? Because look how far we are from here. Just look around you. You see yourself. Ain't no good environment. Mexicans are the only people around here. Telling us to come back tomorrow. I was here yesterday with my proof. This is my proof. I was here yesterday. It's like chicken pasta. It's got pasta in it, cream of mushroom soup. What else we put, Joseph? This is Dr. Joseph.  He's a cardiologist. Yes.
