 Hello?  Yes.  Hi, Ira Glass.  Duki.  Yona Lu. [LAUGHING]  Yeah.  Yona Lu is-- she's a hedgehog. She's basically taken charge of Duki's financial affairs. And I presume this is something to do with money?  That's probably why she said to contact Yona Lu.  Book Duki, OK. You're gonna' book Duki?  Well, I'll just talk to Yona Lu about it. She says OK, it's OK.  She doesn't talk.  You could call me back, or I'll just go in and check.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ira?  This is just radio?  Not TV?  And nobody is going to get to be on TV?  OK. Yona Lu doesn't care what happens then.  I think she'd want to be on, too. [IRA LAUGHING] Even though she doesn't-- I mean, radio doesn't do much for her because she doesn't talk.  He was quite actually bothered by the whole-- he thought we maybe had a problem in the family.  Mm-hm. [AFFIRMATIVE] I mean, for a while there, we had two daughters that only communicated through a duck.  I would say they maybe were 10 and 12 or 9 and 11.  Well, Danielle didn't pay a whole lot of attention to Ashley, but she paid quite a lot of attention to the duck. So if Ashley wanted to get Danielle's attention, all she had to do was rev up the duck.  I can't remember. She'd also make Danielle laugh that way. Danielle thought Duki was very funny, but I can't remember her thinking Ashley was funny.  This is just radio, not TV?
