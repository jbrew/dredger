Well, let's see how happy you are now. Do you believe in God? I said, do you believe in God? Why? Please come back! It's your own fault. And what if you were pregnant? Do you really want to be your own sister's mother? Why does this happen to me? Why can't it just be over? Yes it is. When we die, we can go to heaven and be with Jesus. It's so awesome. It's radical, yeah. Are y'all friends of those people that died in the World Trade Center? You did? You lied to me? No you didn't. No you did not. I'm not going to lie. I've said some of them out loud. I hear it all the time in the hall and stuff. And I guess I'm used to it. Probably a newborn baby, like a new newborn baby that's still in your mom's stomach, but well, the babies that can't talk probably know it but just can't talk, I think. Like when I get into a bad mood, because my cousin, he broke something of mine yesterday, and I had got mad. And I didn't mean to curse and it just slipped out. And I said, you F-ing idiot, you broke my D stuff. And then I had got in trouble. When you're in an argument with somebody, and they take it too far, and then you just want to say, dude, what the H is your problem? Or there's just things you want to say. You cuss when you hurt yourself and it really hurts. I'm sure you cuss, don't you? Do you? Because you can. You're an adult. You have to let yourself free sometimes. Well, I think he meant that it was a really great award that he got. It's a word that you use when you're either very something. If you're very happy, I guess you'd use that. If you're very sad, or very angry at someone, you'd use that. He was very proud of his award. And he was exaggerating brilliant by just using F-ing. Well, I just don't see what the horrible deal is with swearing. But in my opinion, I wouldn't want my grandparents to hear swear words. If we were in a car, and the radio, I wouldn't mind it. But I wouldn't want my grandpa, my grandma to hear the lyrics and the music that I like to listen to. Because it's inappropriate. It might upset them. It might, you know, why does he know these words? Why are we listening to this music? You F-in' B, why don't you get out of my F-in' face? Actually, I'm kind of in the middle of some homework.  Dull.  Quiet.  Very quiet. Activities.  Amazing.  Yes.  Yeah. It's better than it was before, anyways. I liked it. Yeah, because before it was just old ladies. Now it's young people. It was a lot of fun.  Yes, it did. It made me think about, hey, if librarians could do this, make a library not very much a library with making it loud, basically, anyone could do anything.  How did your families take it when you decided to start a rock band?
