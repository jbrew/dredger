 Starving.  Yes. I was starving.  Oh, was that it?  Dave Letterman.  The ultimate.  Yeah.  Impressionist.  We had probably done maybe something with Frank Gorshin.  And the streets are cordoned off. Is that the word?  Here's the deal. We didn't know that the dress rehearsal was something that was looked at very carefully.  Exactly.  And when we get to a punchline, instead of doing--  --We go blah, blah, blah.  Oh my God.  Which was like 25, 30 minutes of--  Blah, blah, blah.  And he said, OK, here's the deal. We're going to put that first girl that comes in--  And then that's what you end with.  What did he say?  Give us a coke-luv.  And he pointed to the machine.  What do you think, we're made out of money, kid?  All we thought about was, I wish this kid would go so we could work on our act. Get out of here.  Actually, our manager, when he called us and said, you're going to be on The Ed Sullivan Show. And he said, and guess what? You're going to be with The Beatles. And we said, who?  This was something different.  I really need to be rigorously honest right now. No, it didn't, no.  All right I'll think it over. No.  It never occurred.  Please.  But, you know what? We hadn't gone on yet. I wanted to know that we were going to be fabulous.  Crazy.  That's when I said I thought I heard, get them off.  Did you hear that?  Yes, sir. Neat, neat, neat, neat, everything nice and neat. That's me. Hello, sir.  Yes sir.  Yes sir, they're neatly waiting outside sir. I'll send them in.  Hi, sir.

If Mr. Sullivan is going to call us over.  Yeah, but I think I saw-- no. Get off.  No, no get off.  No, no. We knew immediately.  Yeah. But see, they didn't have this expression then but, we sucked.  The biggest terror was that we didn't want to go home.  We did not want to go back to Los Angeles.  Sardi's.  Hi, sir. I'm the next young lady's mother. My little girl is waiting outside. She used to be one of The Beatles.  Somebody stepped on her. That was funny. You ad libbed that.  No, you know what comes to--  You know what? There's something wrong with you. It was pathetic.  Mitzi. Mitzi is my name.  Did you call me Dixie?  Who's Dixie?  No, what do you have a girlfriend after--  All right, never mind. It doesn't matter.  Dixie.  What am I doing in this relationship?
