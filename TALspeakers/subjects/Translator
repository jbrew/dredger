 You been at the cafeteria, yes? We were sitting. I heard explosion. And she's talking while she's shivering. It's excellent. He's a good journalist. It's fantastic. It's very good, because they give us the opinion of the people who are in Israel. That there are some writers or journalists that are on our side of the Palestinian problem-- --against their government. It's good to know that there are Israelis who are with us. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING HEBREW] in Hebrew, which is in Arabic [SPEAKING ARABIC], which is soldier. [SPEAKING HEBREW]. Good morning. Please, which is [SPEAKING HEBREW]. [SPEAKING HEBREW], OK. [SPEAKING HEBREW], come here. [SPEAKING HEBREW], dumb. And the baby, [SPEAKING HEBREW]. [SPEAKING ARABIC] The soldiers are saying this to the kids, and the kids are saying this to the soldiers. Whether the rumor is right or correct or not, what we do is convey the rumor by itself without giving our own point of view or our own opinion about this rumor. We need to interview members of ORHA personally to ask them their questions, to know their feelings, to know what kind of measures they are taking. We always try to get information from ORHA. We are always sending our reporters there to the office. But they found difficulties in getting this information. I heard nothing. I heard nothing from them. I don't anything. If he-- Only promises.

And I was really happy because I had him by the hand, because I could show him off to all my little friends. "Look! He's my friend! He's my friend!" I was very proud. I began to show him all this stuff-- how to [? order ?] trash, how to collect boxes and sort out bottles, aluminum. I show him how to do it. And I said to my friends, "Look! Luis come to help me!" Eric arrived, and I was like, ay, he seems so timid, so serious. He was stuck like glue to Luis, just stuck to him. So if Luis moved over there, Eric went too. It was probably his first experience like that, with those kisses we gave him. And that's why he got so embarrassed. What did I think of Eric? I thought, he's still just a kid. He's just a kid.
