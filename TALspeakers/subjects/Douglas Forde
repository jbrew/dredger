I just thought I'd go upstairs. Well, I've been doing it for 84 years. Yeah. Good morning. How are you? I understand the traffic's bad. OK. Yeah, I got it. Shoni will be here. No, Jo, don't. Don't bother. I know you're going to have a good bath. OK. You can do it, Jo. Well, as a matter of fact, once I receive a notice that I'm going to go to sleep, I'm going to go to sleep. Do you follow that? I like to go to sleep. Do you follow that? Good night. I would just assume that you didn't watch all of this. No, I don't. Hi Vicky. I'm well. How are you? [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. What do you want? [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. Well, I would really prefer because I'm ready now actually, I would really prefer not selling it and keeping it. To drive it.

I don't like having people around the house. In what way is there a need for daily nursing? I don't need people here all the time. I notice that when people are here all the time, you're not here. It's as though you're replacing, you're being replaced. Like yesterday, I was really tired of having people around. I don't need anybody except you.
