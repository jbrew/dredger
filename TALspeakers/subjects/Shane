 All right. Well, I'm putting on a head lamp because I have to go look for stuff that might be in the basement.  Monsters. Financial monsters. A Dirt Devil, a couple of bikes.  Taxes, '94, '99. That's going to be in there.  Oh, yeah.  That'd survive an audit.  No, no, no, no. No, no, no. No. Well, the beverage center was high-tech, but it was not internet.  Yeah. I said, "Well, how do you buy a stock?" And he goes, "Well, you have to open a brokerage account, and you probably want to go to one of these discount places where the fees aren't high." Exactly. And I look in the phone book, and there's a discount one, called Olde, and it's downtown. Because it was low fees. I know. I don't know. No. It was like a national chain. It was like the poor man's Schwab. It's easy that it doesn't exist. I'm betting money it's gone.  --go down. That's the regulation press release in '98. What happened there? Oh. Today fined Olde Discount-- Sales practices.  Founder, Ernest Olde, also fined 500,000 and suspended. Yeah. Yeah. He said they're going to make you fill out a form. What is your tolerance for risk? Blah, blah, blah. A lot of money.  Was it the natural ingredients, or the reusable? Or what was the deal?  Right. You ship an ounce of ingredients, and then you add the water when you get there.  I've got to say I would do it all over again. It's genius. There is a genius there.  And that they had wrenches.  The one thing I had heard about investing, buy and hold. So you're not supposed to sell it, even when it goes down, especially when it goes down because that's what the suckers do.  Well, the thing about those little investment chestnuts that they don't tell you is, for example, the buy and hold idea is premised on the theory that you've made a good decision in the first place.  God is not on our side here.  If God is not on your side, how can you expect to make any money in the stock market?  We had no idea what we were doing.
