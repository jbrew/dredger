 I'm Chad Stocker, and I play the bass. Most of the time we play at rock clubs.  I feel like we're almost going to be like tamed beasts. Watch my language. Cover the liquor up off the breath, you know?  Yeah. We are playing inside the libraries most the time. And I went to one yesterday, and the guy showing me, he's like, "This is your stage." And it was, like, the reference desk.  Cigarettes and a cheaper sandwich somewhere else.  Yeah. No. You get something worse than what they would give you so you can save the money. That is good. That's a very intelligent question.  Josh is kind of-- Josh is kind of in charge of cleaning the laundry.  The truth is, bands, nowadays, are in libraries all the time because there's the internet and stuff there. And when you're on the road, it's a valuable place to go for a band. It's like the field office. I used to work at the Ann Arbor district library as a security guard there in college.  And we used to have to kick out people that had their shoes off, or if they smelled too bad and got complaints, or if we caught them cleaning up in the bathroom, and stuff. And then, years later, I'm doing that.  There was kids that were scared when we were in Brighton. Yeah. Even though we were outside, they still had faces of disbelief. Or they were like, this is not what-- everyone's always telling me to be quiet here. This is not supposed to be happening. Yeah. Yeah, almost to where they were angered. They were angered. Like, everything everyone's been telling me up to this point has been a lie.  Another exciting thing about libraries are-- and this is something that we need, terribly-- are maps and atlases. This is all reference material. You can check it out, but you can't check it out. You know what I'm saying?  What?  Aren't Oompa Loompas green?  Oh. I like their pants. Oompa Loompa's got cool, cool clothes. 1, 2, 3. On the high end of average. Yeah.
