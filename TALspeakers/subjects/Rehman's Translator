 Actually, the main thing is--  Yes, the guns, and the anti-aircraft guns.  Do you have something latest, latest missiles, something sinister, just like Stinger with an effective range of at least 15,000 feet?  Give me the details about that one.  Yes, the anti-aircraft gun and anything else you think is important. Ammo?  Do these people also have submarines?  Good.  And also get me order for night vision goggles.  That's something for seeing at night.  Yes, they need a lot of them. It is their demand.  Yes, I was looking for a serious person. After meeting with you, I felt that this could also be done.  Wow.  Yes, I like it very much.  This is my favorite.  Yes, I like it most.  Yes.  Really, it is very delicious.  Haha, that's what I told you.  Will you eat some?  Yes.  About 200.  Please sit down.

It has a serial number.  This is the serial number, and we don't need it.  Because.  It can be tracked from the serial number.  Look here, I have removed it.  Right.  Boss, from here, if four, five, or six planes fall, what will happen?  What will happen to their economy?  You mean different airports at the same time?  Like Sunday morning.  What is the busiest day for flights?  Monday?
