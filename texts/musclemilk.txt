  I admit I tend to be conservative.  I have not cared for Obama's first four years.  I am not a Mitt fan.  I have read so many Facebook pages about Obama being a racist, etc, but did not want to form an opinion until I had read his book.  Well, I am dumbfounded that we, as Americans (you can be white, yellow, orange, black or brown, but once you can vote, you are a US citizen!)voted this bigot into office.  I was dumbfounded about how racist his views are.  Further, given that his grandparents who raised him are Caucasian, I would expect him to be more open minded.As a "read", this book has nothing to say.......  I believe this writer is so intent on using "big words" that he fails to convey a useful message of any kind.  I am intelligent, and benefitted from attending some of the best and most prestigious schools in the USA, but I could not follow many of this man's thoughts/statements until I read them several times over.  Once I had expended that effort, I realized (repeatedly) that the writer was only trying to impress by using uncommonly used words.  What a crock.I can appreciate that Mr. Obama missed hisAfrican roots and wanted to explore them....it is his heritage.  I even applaud his determination.  However, I can't respect a man who has such a closed mind concerning race relations, and who has not worked a day outside of "government" work.  Work in the private sector.  Work for the good of ALL people.... Then come talk to me.  Until then, almost sadly, I have no choice but to support the ultra annoying Mitt. I bought this book in 2012 to try to understand this president.As in real life, in this book Obama give the positive & the negative of the situations/issues he discusses but he never take a position. He cannot make up his mind. If you ever doubted that Barack Obama is full of himself, read this book and doubt no more. This piece of self aggrandizing dribble is pathetic. The tone is pedantic and arrogant throughout. A waste of money if you buy it and a waste of time if you read it to the end. I kept waiting to read something about the real barrack, never did figure out what dreams he got from his father.  I did get how much he hates white people. A roadmap to Obama's failed presidency and the global collapse....We must stop pulling our punches in these dangerous times.America doesn't have the luxury of time to wait out the presidential term of this dangerously dysfunctional president.The synergy of asymmetric warfare, nanosecond systems of global reach, porous borders and a generation disaffected, amoral, programmed and desensitized –savages lying in wait, favors the jihadist.Obama is clearly incapacitated. We cannot compel him to become capable. (Or moral.)And even if we could, he would sabotage any forced effort, witness Afghanistan.  Indeed, witness his latest ISIS head-fake malfeasance.The only rational solution is to remove Obama for incapacity – Section 4 of the 25th Amendment was conceived precisely for this purpose.The political class understands this, yet not one of them seems to have the courage merely to enunciate it.We the people must find a way to remove him. The political class clearly lacks the courage. As do the media. Even Fox. I don't think most of this is true.  How does he know what his fathers dreams were, he only saw him twice in his life. A man full of hate for those that are not like himself (namely whites).  Although this book is disturbing, it is an important read for those that want to understanding the man and the direction he wants to take our country. I felt the book shaped his ideology and perhaps not in the most positive way.I was glad to see he had other family and how large it is. If I hadn't read this book I still wouldn't know the size of his family.The book is long and drudges on and on. I felt it could of been told with fewer words.  If there are any cliff notes, I recommend you stop there. I felt I was reading a story about a Narcissist who was trying to justify how great he thought he was. It could have been about a "Hitler" in the making. I read it to the end and felt so discouraged, knowing this man today. Vacuous, shallow and vague.  I was looking for insight into the man and got pages marked with thoughtless, empty words.         THIS IS A REWRITE WITHOUT TELLING THE READERS JUST WHAT HE CHANGED IN THE REWRITE. This book is just like everthing surrounding this imposters life, lies! In the book it's okay for him to make up stuff as if it were real, he is completely incompetent but does have a masterful imagination. Should stick to fiction. Too wordy. His sentences ramble on and on and on, changing subjects and stuffing in as many big words as he can. I had much more respect for him before I read the book. I am sure he has a lot of valuable insight to share I just wish he could get over himself so I could stop falling asleep throughout the book. Although originally published in 1995, this book has a new forward by then US Senator Obama and was republished in 2005. Of course, there is a second book by Senator Obama, and his record in his political campaigns and office holding, especially the campaign for US President and his words and actions in office that are part of the mosaic, and this book can no longer be reviewed as a stand alone of the person who originally wrote it in the 1990's. This review is intended to be read first, before my review of The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream (Vintage), his second book, is read. One should read these two books in that order also. In this post-9/11 world, both what is said and what is not said are equally telling. Before proceeding, every reviewer should know that I have spent over 9,000 hours studying Islam since 9/11. It was an epiphany for me. I have studied the political ideology of Islam, i.e. how Islamic beliefs and actions have affected and do affect folks while on this earth. I have not, and do not care to, study, in any depth, what I consider to be the purely religious aspects of Islam. I have put together, edited, over 3,500 pages of documentation, written over 300 pages myself, and am working on over 1,000 pages more, titled AMERABIA, about the mortal danger the USA is in of becoming an Islamist nation, in whole or in parts, well before 2100, with Michiganistan becoming the first state in the union with first a functional Islamist majority, and then an absolute majority, that will replace our MI Constitution with Sharia Law. Some members of the United States House of Representatives Anti-Terrorism Caucus, 122 members, 40 Democrats, including Rep. Sue Myrick, the Chair of the Caucus, have copies of my documentation on their credenza, and refer to the future of America by my title. The Qur'an has far more and far worse hatred of Jews, both quantitatively and qualitatively, than Mein Kampf, and the Prophet Muhammad makes Hitler seam like the nicest person you would ever want to know and have as your neighbor, as Muhammad was a prophet who was not like Jesus, but like Attila the Hun or Genghis Khan.. Islam is the single bloodiest political ideology that ever stalked this planet, killing more non-Muslims that the entire 20th century killed in total, including all those killed in war. Our own Muslims here in Michigan want Sharia Law to replace our Constitution and are having 8 or more babies per family. We also call it Dearbornistan for darn good reasons. Islam is not a race, as most Muslims are not Arabs, and there are wonderful, peaceful Christian and Jewish Arabs. Muslims can believe that Islam is a religion, but that does not mean that the rest of us should be so ignorant and believe that. Yes, there are peaceful Muslims, but will they actively oppose the Jihadists? Iraq and Afghanistan will slide backwards so fast it will make our heads spin. Will "peaceful" Muslims oppose the imposition of Sharia law? The answer in Europe and America, as well as Islamist lands, is no. England, Russia, Austria, and perhaps some other European countries, plus Canada and some South American countries, will have Islamist majorities around the middle of this century, and will be almost totally Islamist before the end of this century. Whether one calls it WW III, and whether that occurs before, during or after our own 2nd Civil War, we, the USA, are in mortal danger of becoming an Islamist country also, albeit, not demographically, at least initially. Islam is a patriarchal belief set. Muslim men may marry non-Muslim women, as Obama's dad did with his mother. Muslim Women are not allowed to marry non-Muslim men, but in dar al-Harb (a non-Islamic land, or, more literally, the Land of War), Muslim Women are pushed to marry some non-Muslim men in order to lie to them about how Islam is a "Religion of Peace" and influence them to allow Islamists to take over the country from the inside out. A great example is Grover Norquist, whose wife, Samah, from "Palestine" represents the view that Hamas, Fatah, and Hezbollah are all peaceful folks that we should snuggle up to. In dar al-Islam, or an Islamist country, such as Egypt, no Coptic Christian male is allowed to even date a Muslim woman, and Coptic Christians have been killed for doing so, as have Christians and non-Muslims in all Islamic countries throughout history. Obama admits that his dad is a Muslim. He admits that his Mom is an atheist. He admits that his step-dad is a Muslim. It is all quite understated. Because Obama's dad was a Muslim, he is a Muslim, until or unless he converts to a different religion, no matter how "secular" and "non-practicing" he is. He lived in a Muslim majority country (95%), Indonesia, for over 4 years. Per this book, he attended two schools, one a local school and one an "International" (Catholic/Christian) school for two years each. That he was registered at both schools as a Muslim is not in this book, nor is that he attended religion classes in both schools, both on Islam, since he was registered as a Muslim. Obama has said that he cut up in class. I'm sure he did some of the time. I'm also sure he was taught the little kid version of Islam. In addition, he also attended Mosque from time to time, although he initially denied that during his campaign for President. This documentation regarding his registration, etc, is from Daniel Pipes (head of the MEF), who has photos of the original registrations and curricula, and has done original research. I lived overseas for almost 3 1/2, years, graduating from high school at the International School of Brussels (Belgium). My experience in Western Europe was extremely different from Obama's. I learned, very differently, that America is the finest country in the world, that it is a Shining City on a Hill, while Obama has very mixed reviews about America and Americans in this book. I also learned that kids the age of Obama (6-10) in foreign lands only learn the little kid version of the culture they live in, which, regarding Islam, is entirely inappropriate, and irrelevant, in a grown up world. There are indications that the little kid version lives on in Obama, but there are also open questions about whether he has also learned the adult version, and is practicing taqqiya (the mainstream Islamist practice and teaching that lying to non-Muslims about who you are, your beliefs and values; and to hide and disguise the true nature of Islam from all non-Muslims is approved and commanded). "She taught me to disdain the blend of ignorance and arrogance that too often characterized Americans abroad" (p47). So I, as an American abroad, my Dad, my Mom, my brothers and sister, my friends and the hundreds of Americans I knew were ignorant and arrogant? It takes an ignorant and arrogant person to make such a baldly false statement, but that is the kind of pap and pablum Obama was fed by his Mom; and that he bought into. Most Americans overseas were middle class businessmen, trying to do their best to earn a living, make their companies successful, and raise their families as Americans in a non-American environment. From all of the Belgian friends I had, all I can say is that the "ugly American" is mostly a myth. At best those that might be characterized as "ugly", as there are some in every nationality, were far and few between. There are numerous books written that take Obama to task for his associations with disreputable and questionable characters, both explained in this book and otherwise. I will pass on those aspects, and concentrate on the Islamist aspects of this book. Obama admits to admiring Malcolm X, as a Muslim. That's not fine, as Malcolm X was the leading edge of the mainstreaming of Black American Muslims into the Wahhabi and Islamist fold, as Louis Farrakhan, and his blatant, open, anti-semitism display today. "Regina was on her way to Andalusia...". (p.116) This seeming casual statement is another indicator of how Obama is steeped in Islamist beliefs and propaganda. Andalusia refers to Spain when it was Islamist. Jihadists refer to Spain as Andalusia to ensure that everyone knows that it was once theirs, and they intend to take it back. Andalusia also refers to the myth of a "golden age" of peaceful Islam in Spain. As Reza Aslan, author of "No God but God" states, there was no such golden age. From the numerous books and articles I have read, plus the knowledgeable scholars I have talked to. I concur with Aslan (which I usually don't). In 1066AD, at the height of the alleged "Golden age", the Jews in Cordoba peacefully spoke out and demonstrated against the imposition of Sharia Law and their status as "dhimmi", or "kafirs", 2nd class, semi-slaves. The Jews thought the Muslims had "moderated". Oops! The "peaceful" Muslims slaughtered 5,000 of them for daring to speak out. "Andalusia is a myth. But this is part of Obama's totally fabricated belief set, which affects his actions as President. Obama had a Pakistani for a roommate between Oxy and Harvard, to the best of trying to divine what this book states. Obama has subsequently admitted that he went to Pakistan for two weeks with his roommates (plural). Maybe these were nice folks, but they were Muslims, and Pakistan is not the spring break garden spot, it is one of the worlds greatest hotbeds for the Jihadists. Obama has never stated who he met, what they talked about, and what he did in Pakistan. Maybe it is all innocent. But why has Obama not fully disclosed what happened? This is germaine  to who he is and what he has done as President. On pp 183 -184 he rants against civilization, industrialization, and capitalization. In short, he believes that factories that are set up in foreign lands destroy the ability of the natives to live of off the land as their parents did, and when the factories close, the workers are left helpless. Without going into the details of this argument, which I disagree with, he includes the West Bank as one of the regions that was so devastated. There is zero truth to that statement. There is no documentation to back up that statement. It is a total fabrication, but it is part of the Islamist apologist belief set, just as is the belief that Israel and the US government knocked down the twin towers on 9/11, which the Muslims in Flint still teach in their maddrassah. Ultimately:FACT: Obama was a Muslim, by Islam's rules, when he was born.FACT: Obama stayed a Muslim until, or unless, he converted to another religion, by  Islam's rules.FACT: Obama was a Muslim at least until he was 27, when he purportedly converted to  Black Liberation Theology in Reverend Wright's Church. Once again, Islam's  own rules, no matter how secular and non-practicing he appears to be.FACT: The penalty, by Islam's own rules, for apostasy, leaving Islam, as an adult, is  death. Numerous Islamists should be foaming at the mouth at the chance to fulfill  Muhammad's commandment.. One normally converts from one major religion to another for a reason, such as the new religion is more attractive, but when converting away from Islam, it is also normally because one has found out the truth about the horrors of Islam. Obama still snuggles up to Islamist beliefs, so should anyone believe he has converted? Or is he practicing taqqiya, as Islam teaches, promotes, and allows? The rest of the story is only told in his second book and his actions as a US Senator and as President. Completely stupid
