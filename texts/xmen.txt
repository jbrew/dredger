Dialogue comes out stilted and unnatural, with awkward performances from much of the cast.- Story? Not really bothering with one. Side-stories concerning the characters? Started and then just dropped. Completely dropped.- Nonsense changes from the outcome of the last movie. Charles erased Moira's memories of the last event. For no apparent reason. At all. Also... it was basically rape. Mind/memory rape... and everyone seems to think it's just cute and funny that he did that. It's not. It's horrific.- They don't seem to understand the powers of the characters in the movie... even after establishing them. Nightcrawler can't go through a wire cage. No, he can't go "through" electrical current-areas now. It's... beyond unclear and doesn't make sense. He teleports, director, he doesn't "go through" things. That's why he can appear in *places he knows well without having to see it, you explained his powers in the movie yourself*. It's one thing to just change the way a character's powers work... it's another to go out of your way to explain how they work and then actively work against your own explanation.- People were upset, in the past, how poorly the Phoenix Saga was represented. Well, the director has listened to our complaints, and straight-up ignored them. Same thing's going on with Jean, she's just crazypants.- Writer 1: "Darn, we ceded too much power to our villain and he has control of Prof. X... what do we do with the story now?"Writer 2: "Just magically give him the power to fight the villain out of nowhere for what is clearly no good reason except that we don't know where to go with this".Then he's easily defeated, anyway, and that part of the fight is rendered not only non-nonsensical but pointless, as well.- Think Beast is a cool character? Meh, he's just some scientist for most of the movie, and is only beast near the end. Oh, the **** version, not an interesting version. Enjoy.- Wolverine shows up, and mostly kills some people off-camera before disappearing. One okay spot in the movie. Then he's gone.- Prof. X knows that he's teaching a kid, Cyclops, to use his powers and that uncontrollable, powerful lasers come out of his eyes. So they set up beside a pond and have him shoot at a target by a big tree. The tree is destroyed. Prof X puts the kid on a big guilt trip about how his great grandfather planted that tree and it was his favourite spot in all the world. **** you, Xavier, the kid had a blindfold on because of his laser eyes, and you set him up to shred your favourite thing, then blamed him. To hell with this movie. Again, this director has zero respect for the source material. No, really, I'm not making that up. He BANNED all comic books from the sets of the X-Men movies.… Expand Awful, awful film.

It's over extended, boring and contains a lot of crappy realized scenes. I understand that It takes place in the 80's but that artificial creation of the mood just don't fit. Colors are like from the disco or a 90s porn movie and stuff like Mortal Kombat costumes in Auschwitz are some kind of a sick joke. But the worst thing are the scenes which take place in Poland. I'm from Poland and I can assure you we have laughed out loud of those. Actors trying to build up the mood in foreign language look just silly and I'm sure that's not the kind of atmosphere you want on the screen when drama takes place! Also, the main villain is a mix of funny guy and some angry kid who can't even choose his companions wisely. But hey, he can do some mumbo jumbo with his hands and give some nice toys to his mates - so awesome. I must admit tho', that the movie has some cool characters and decent scenes (Quicksilver rulez) but that's all.

How on earth do critics diss the well-done Warcraft movie and tolerate this one (though not saying much, because there's really nothing to praise here)? It's the old "really bad guy from ancient times (Egypt) comes back and tries to take over the wooorld" trope, with that really being just it. Only action scenes after one another make for puke-inspiring pacing and some really horrific "few seconds of idyllic life, family gets killed, now Magneto is evil" crap tropes filled over all the scenes they spared some dialogue on. Derp-faces all over. Singer should be ashamed.

Not much to say other than that, but for people that don't see how obviously stupid this film is let me explain to you why. Actors were bored out of their minds and it showed in every single scene. The script is full of hyperbole and couldn't amuse a child. The cinematography and over all visual style lacked detail and originality and all too often it came off looking like a cartoon. The CGI that permeated almost every single scent made the film look cheap, despite the film costing an insane amount of money. They could have saved a lot of money and gone with stop motion animation and miniatures and it would have looked way better. The characters are all one dimensional and very boring. The film over and over attempted to force you to feel something with visuals and music, instead of having a story and a script that would actually make you feel something. The emotional manipulation was extremely obvious and cheesy beyond belief. I think the real issue is that they are trying to get new viewers, they are catering to the young adult crowed, instead of making a film for the original fans, who are all in their 30s and 40s, who would demand something more sophisticated and emotionally real. This young adult genre of films is a huge cash cow, but ultimately produces nothing worth anyone's time. Don't waste your brain cells on this producer driven shell of a film.… Expand Critics are not too harsh! This movie might have a few great moments and the X-Men are well portrayed but in general the movie does not contain a plausible storyline and I never really felt any emotional connections to any of the characters. The fact that a movie uses special effects well is not nearly enough to produce a great movie. One of my main issues is the villain itself. He spends half the movie creating new fancy looking pieces of armor for his randomly picked "powerful" followers and therefore was neither credible nor menacing in any way. I enjoyed Deadpool, loved Civil Wars but I would not recommend watching this movie.… Expand DUMB & CHEESY!!! The critics are right on the money with this one! The story is incredibly dumb.

Quicksilver,There's a whole bunch of reasons why X-Men:Apocalypse is such a terrible horrible mess of a movie. It could be because all of the characters are severely under-developed to the point that no one cares what happens to them. Quicksilver, Psylocke, Angel, NightCrawler, Havok, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm. These are all characters that we met in the film but were not explained at all or nearly enough for anyone to care about them. Psylocke (Olivia Munn) looked great. Ok, she looked like Olivia Munn cosplaying as Psylocke which if you know Olivia Munn isn't actually that amazing, since it's sorta her thing. However, I can't recall her having more than a couple of lines in the film and most of the time she was just standing around as a background lackey. Not much different from Storm and Angel, the other so-called "four horsemen" of Apocalypse (the 4th being Magneto).  At some point in the film Quicksilver randomly shows up and does something super cool....the best sequence of the film actually.....but unfortunately as a result of what happened, someone who is supposed to be a major character but didn't get any film time died. I'm shedding a tear as we speak. Of course, this film is called "X-men: Apocalypse" and so if I didn't talk about the blue guy himself, it just wouldn't be right. Ah, Apocalypse. What the hell happened to you? People who don't read X-Men comics, read the following words carefully: Apocalypse is one of the scariest mofos in the Marvel Universe. He is a villain that causes superheroes to crap their pants when he shows up looking to cause trouble. This is a guy who is so evil, so powerful, so insane...that he has tortured and massacred some of the most well known X-Men in the past and literally changed the entire timeline of the Marvel Universe for awhile (see Age of Apocalypse). Now, with that in mind, WTF was Singer thinking when he gave us....this....this....ugly blue guy in horrible looking samurai armor? This film's Apocalypse is nothing compared to the Apocalypse of the Marvel Universe. This film's Apocalypse looks like a mutant Smurf that's been drinking one too many potions in Gargamel's laboratory. He's small, he's puny, he's ridiculous. I did not feel like the X-Men were in danger when I saw him on screen. Everytime I saw him, I couldn't help but laugh. He didn't strike fear or terror or make me anxious to see what happens next. All I could think about was how stupid he looked and acted. Ooooh, I'm going to destroy the world and rebuild it the way I like. Great plan, buddy. Because 20,000 villains before you haven't had the same plan and pulled it off successfully, right? That's not Apocalypse's M.O. And the way that they defeated him. Really? This isn't a spoiler by the way. I mean it's an "X-Men" movie. Obviously the X-Men are going to win, right? But the way he was defeated was so ridiculous and so easy compared to what other things the X-Men have gone up against that it was a total waste of time for them and completely negated any idea that Apocalypse was powerful and menacing in the first place. C'mon, Singer if you're going to churn out crap like this then man up and give the property back to Marvel so they can atleast do something respectable with it.… Expand Well lets get the pluses out of the way. That was quick, now on to the negatives.

The CG in this film is atrocious and extremely distracting. I dont know what happened but many of the 3d models looked unfinished especially their textures. They surfaces look too perfect and the effects from powers like Magneto looked very cheesy as well. Next, Apocalypse is about 5 feet tall and his armor looks life foam... the quality of costumes and makeup for his character were a travesty and reminded me of the kind of stuff you see in low budget TV shows like Dr. Who. The only thing he had going for him was his synthesized voice. Next, this was a sort of origins type story for the prominent X-Men but it strays a bit from the comics. This is fine and well if the origins made sense, but they didnt. For instance, Storm is depicted as an Arab with a Mohawk running around Egypt stealing and living on the streets. Well lets assume for a second that all that is believable, the question is why in blazes does she just use wind or other powers to take what she wants? She clearly had the powers already, yet she still got her hands dirty for almost no reason. Then we have Quicksilver (again) who is basically a God but somehow manages to be completely useless (yet again) despite having the power to pretty much end the story on his own. For instance, he could have found Charles and ran him to another continent during the showdown but instead he decides to go meet daddy because you know... he couldnt make time for both... oh wait... yea he could have. He could have saved Charles, plucked all the feathers off Angel, stripped Psylocke to her panties, shaved Storms head, grabbed a Cappuccino from Starbucks and he still would have had time to spare to talk to daddy... but no... instead he decides to go talk to dad and then go and fight Apocalypse. And then there is the fight... he could have skewered Apocalypse with 1000 shiesh kabobs, lit his feet on fire, teabagged him a few times, and then severed his head with a butter knife but nope... what does he do? Slaps him a few times and punches him in the gut... whatever. Next we have Charles who was basically worthless despite being able to control pretty much anyone he wants. At any time, he could have controlled any of the horsemen but instead he just sat around useless crying for help. Jean was also practically worthless until she "let go" and allowed her powers out which meant, we got to see a glimpse of the Phoenix again (yay... not). In the movies she has become a one trick pony because the movie writers think this is all she is good for. Oh what else... at least the didnt mess up Scotts part then again he didnt really do much anyway except mow down a door. Just a lot of wasted action and I have played 15 year old video games with better CG than this.… Expand This movie is just lame.
