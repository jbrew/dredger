Be careful what you order.  There are two editions of this book; the 1995 edition and the revised 2004 edition.  Note that the 2nd edition lists the 1995 printing first, but that not be what you get.  I spent $115 hoping to get the rare, first edition, which supposedly has photos and different text.  Instead, I got a hardcover version of the 2004 revised printing.  Since the 1995 book was published when Obama was still a relative nobody it stands to reason the first edition had a limited circulation.  Don't order the book unless you can see a picture of the cover.  If it looks like the 2004 paperback, then it's not the 1st edition. "Dreams from my Father" is a depressing, disturbing work, one that presents a bleak and hopeless vision of America's future. Barack Obama's memoir hinges on the premise that defeating racism depends upon white people understanding black people, and that white people can never understand black people. If that's true, we as Americans are doomed to never having any sense of brotherhood or common cultural ground that crosses the racial divide, and we might as well acknowledge that blacks are all filled with rage and have highly justified reasons for despising whites. Another point Obama takes pains to underline is that biracial/multicultural identity does not exist, and people who have mixed-race ancestry are angry, miserable and emotionally messed up because of their forebears' decision to intermarry.Buying into Obama's segregationist policies means that every black/biracial person I have ever met has treated me with calculated deceit. I refuse to believe that.  Therefore, I reject his philosophy.Barack Obama is not a person I can relate to on any level.He's a complete narcissist, and reading some passages was an uncomfortable experience (like watching someone pleasure himself while gazing into a mirror). I do wonder if he remains at this level of an angst-ridden adolescent. This book came out when he was an adult (note: I read the edition which came out after his election to the senate, but the manuscript was published a few years prior to that, after he and Michele married) so it's entirely possible he's in some state of arrested development.Obama traces his life from childhood in Hawaii through his college years and eventually to his visit to Africa.Obama's mother was an unstable, flighty girl who, as a college kid in Hawaii, hauled home an African classmate. Barack Senior had a wife and kids back home in Kenya, but that didn't stop him from impregnating Barack's mom, and then committing bigamy by marrying her. Her white Midwestern parents (her dad had a weird fixation with black people and seeks out their company all his life) embraced their new son-in-law, although Obama pere is revealed to be an alcoholic philanderer who was officious, abusive and delusional, and who ultimately abandoned his American wife and little Barry. (The dad's multiple marriages in Africa overlap, and he discards families like expired produce--it's very sad and confusing.)Obama has described his maternal grandmother as racist, and he includes a passage where, close to retirement but still working to pay his tuition, she is menaced by a black street person while waiting for a bus. Her husband and her grandson Barack react with outrage. But not at the guy threatening her. At HER--for mentioning that the man who harassed her was black.In fact, his mom and her parents worked diligently to expose him to heroes of the Civil Rights movement, and they idealized his African heritage. I think that's why Obama resents white people. He lived with whites and saw them as "real" people, while blacks were elevated to a superhuman status. Unfortunately, maturity never brought the insight that people are people.Mom took him to Indonesia for her marriage #2, and this prevented him from becoming "a boorish American." (Oh, really? Just one among many slams against the United States. I am surprised he wants to live in, much less run, this country.) He soon returns to the only stability he knows-- his doting grandparents who struggle to provide a middle-class upbringing and the opportunity to attend an exclusive private school. Bad call: he's spoiled and talks about envying rich classmates. He fights, he parties. He wallows in his perceived status as an outsider. Later, as a college student, he drinks heavily, smokes pot and snorts coke. (But never, he is proud to point out, tries heroin.) You may say, "Well, everyone that age experiments a little!" but there's a difference between that and being a burnout.  He's eventually radicalized, and although he takes a job at a law firm (he calls this "working for the enemy"), he quits with some vague idea of becoming an activist.On the South Side of Chicago he becomes a community organizer. Then the story gets really sketchy.  Obama lived at my former (now closed) parish. He never mentions this, and he is derisive of the priests who were actually doing community service. Natch: they're white and therefore can't relate to black people. He implies that he's nobly toiling alone for the Greater Good, when in fact he was supported by the very people he dismisses. Frankly, despite moving in the same circles for several years, living in the same neighborhood and volunteering for some of the same social outreach programs, I never once heard his name mentioned. He made no impact--he even admits this when he returns to the neighborhood after grad school.But his disloyalty doesn't end with his treatment of his grandparents, his mentors, and his nation, it extends to Reverend Jeremiah Wright. Wright welcomes him into his church, provides spiritual grounding, and eventually marries Obama and his wife. Obama speaks glowingly of Wright in this book...but the book was written when Wright was USEFUL to Obama. A few years later, after some of Wright's more controversial statements were publicized, Obama does what he does best and throws Wright under the bus, too.Obama devotes a section of the book to his pilgrimage to Kenya, where he meets dad's side of the family. Kenya, as we know, is no stranger to ethnic violence that often claims lives around election time, and it's not black-vs.-white--it's Luo vs. Bantu vs. Masai vs. Kikuyu.  Of course, until the European colonialists arrived, the Luo lived a utopic existence marred only by forced abductions, female circumcision, and wife beatings. We have to overlook the fact that East Africa was first invaded by Arab slave traders who forced many of the tribes to accept Islam, or that the dastardly European colonialists also worked to illegalize slavery. That doesn't fit with the narrative.But African life is no cakewalk. Obama describes endemic poverty, illiteracy, rampant corruption and poor health care. His male relatives seem singularly self-absorbed, while the long-suffering women appear more stable. Obama learns that his grandfather tried Christianity for awhile, but "could not understand such concepts as mercy toward one's enemies, so he converted to Islam." Needless to say, Barack's visit abroad engenders no appreciation of the U.S., although he ultimately returns.Obama never cogently explains why he decided to go into public service or how he expects to accomplish his (ill-defined) goals. Someone once described him as "an empty suit." The author of this book certainly fits that bill.Obama's presidency was lauded by many as heralding a post-racist society, but the man who wrote this book hasn't, and will probably never, transcend the simplistic and demeaning ethnic limitations he invests in.There has been an ongoing controversy over whether Obama wrote this memoir or if it was written by his pal Bill Ayers. It is similar enough in style to Ayers's "Days of Rage" that this is certainly a plausible theory. But Obama, again, displays an astounding disloyalty to another person who made him who he is today. Either Ayers wrote the book, heavily edited (re-wrote) it, or inspired it. No matter which, it is ungentlemanly behavior to not credit Ayers at all.Nevertheless, "Dreams" is regarded as a book that represents Obama. All voting Americans should read it. We should have read it before the last election, and we should have all paid attention to its cynical and self-serving message. I read it for perspective.  I got perspective.  I hate the perspective but I achieved what I sought.  If you want to understand where Mr. Obama wants to take America and understand why he's doing what he's doing, read this. I read this book hoping to gain some perspective on how President Obama came to his ideas about our country, none of which I agree on.What I found was a constant bashing from the black man on the white man. His mother, a white woman, raised him as best she could and shielded him so well from racism that he did not even know it existed until he had his first black friend in high school--a friend who poisoned his mind with pure hate for white people. Then, as if Obama was mad at his mother for not doing the same, he deserted her after high school and became more associated with more radical, white-person-hate-filled blacks. I don't understand how his mom concludes Barack gets his "honesty and good character" from his father, who deserted him as a toddler and eventually became a bitter drunk.I think it is not coincidental that Obama holds such negative beliefs about white people, yet never experienced racism himself and is the President of the United States. If this doesn't prove that black people are offered as much opportunity as whites, I do not know what does.Anyone who walks away from this book "inspired" I would quickly have to ask why/how. It is scary to think this kind of talk proliferates in the black community. Black men tearing each other down and constantly blaming their failures on the "white man" will not progress black men any further. Black men deserting the mothers of their children and not raising their children, in particular their boys, will do nothing to raise that particular segment of the community along. I know plenty of successful black people, and I can rest assured they do not look for racism in the faces of every white person they see, nor blame their problems on the "white man."White people have struggles too--I struggled my whole life and was told many times I would fail, yet I am here and have managed to accomplish most of what I set out to do. I have also experienced racism from blacks yet do not hold it against them. Racism exists within every community and every race. Yet I would have to argue that where I see most racism playing out today is actually within the black community. If "certain" oppressed black people want to move up in the world, then they should (1) commit and stay with the mother of your child/children and (2) stop blaming others for your mistakes and ignore what you may think to be racism. Constantly tearing each others dreams down and calling each other the "n" word, while saying the white man will never let you get anywhere does NOTHING for progress.I opened this book hoping for a deeper understanding of a man I did not understand. I walked away with it more disgusted with racism and perpetual hate within the black community. I purchased this book with an open mind -- hoping to better understand this enigmatic man.  I came away from the experience feeling like I had just read a volume of tall tales.  Barack Obama is a narcissist, who turns out to be the sole hero in every story he spins.  This biography is clearly an attempt to garner some recognition in his run for the presidency.  There was not a sincere word in this book.  If you are interested in reading I recommend purchasing a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf as a reference volume. Didn't like it at all, seemed far fetched to me and many times I was so bored with it that I was going to just stop reading it, however I did push on and read it through to end and when finished, I wished I wouldn't have wasted my time reading it at all.  I will however recommend reading it because this is just my opinion. I do not recommend this product.  I am very interested in the background of Barack Obama and have read several different biographies, so I was interested in hearing Obama read his own book.  I had read the print version of his autobiography and was very interested in hearing several portions of the book read in the author's own voice.  I was very disappointed to find that the audio book was heavily edited to remove any section that might be politically embarrassing to the author. For example, in the original Obama autobiography there was much written on his visits to Kenya and his interaction with his relatives and family homes. In the audio book this part of his original book was edited to the point of being non-existent and the family and geographic ties expressed so strongly in the original book had been removed. If you are after a "feel good" book about our president this will fill the bill, but if you are after an understanding of the feelings of Obama toward his family and the country of his forefathers, read the print version of the book.  For a follow on to the print version, I would recommend reading the Dinesh D'Souza book, "The Roots of Obama's Rage". The D'Souza book develops the Obama-Kenya ties and gives a plausible framework for Obama's actions in later life. Note the absence of stars marked.  It takes a tremendous ego to decide to write an autobiography at age 30, particularly when your employer thinks you are writing something related to your position.  I read this in an effort to find more about the President and it is obvious to me why it didn't sell until he was campaigning in 2008.  I made myself read a chapter every evening in order to finish.  It is boring.  The author is clearly caught up with his own importance and spends an inordinate amount of time describing himself and things that did not in any way relate to the story.  Every move in Kenya is dragged on and on including his relieving himself and taking a shower.  He may be President and may be able to charm folks with his "folksy" speeches, but as a writer?  Not even!  The only thing I gleaned from the book is that he is anything other than the Obama he projects.  The important part is, he didn't even know his father!  A waste of good reading time that could have been spent on an author who isn't in love with themselves. With the benefit of hind sight it's easy to pick out the false hoods in Obama's fabricated narrative.  I've come to believe Bill Ayers probably did author most if not all of this crock. Obama is energized and vindicated by radically violent progressives like Bill Ayers. Of all the people protesting Vietnam, Ayers lead the most conscienceless anti-Americans. That's what turned Obama on the most! And his dependence on Ayers and his family all those years was the core of the smug, anti-American rage he brings to politics.Ayers cooked up the Obama myth by ghostwriting Dreams from My Father, and admits he spun these tales about a brilliant kid who overcomes racism to work for unity and freedom for all.And that's who has been purposefully destroying our republic.  Be careful what you order.  There are two editions of this book; the 1995 edition and the revised 2004 edition.  Note that the 2nd edition lists the 1995 printing first, but that not be what you get.  I spent $115 hoping to get the rare, first edition, which supposedly has photos and different text.

I admit I tend to be conservative.  I have not cared for Obama's first four years.  I am not a Mitt fan.  I have read so many Facebook pages about Obama being a racist, etc, but did not want to form an opinion until I had read his book.  Well, I am dumbfounded that we, as Americans (you can be white, yellow, orange, black or brown, but once you can vote, you are a US citizen!)voted this bigot into office.  I was dumbfounded about how racist his views are.  Further, given that his grandparents who raised him are Caucasian, I would expect him to be more open minded.As a "read", this book has nothing to say.......  I believe this writer is so intent on using "big words" that he fails to convey a useful message of any kind.  I am intelligent, and benefitted from attending some of the best and most prestigious schools in the USA, but I could not follow many of this man's thoughts/statements until I read them several times over.  Once I had expended that effort, I realized (repeatedly) that the writer was only trying to impress by using uncommonly used words.  What a crock.I can appreciate that Mr. Obama missed hisAfrican roots and wanted to explore them....it is his heritage.  I even applaud his determination.  However, I can't respect a man who has such a closed mind concerning race relations, and who has not worked a day outside of "government" work.  Work in the private sector.  Work for the good of ALL people.... Then come talk to me.  Until then, almost sadly, I have no choice but to support the ultra annoying Mitt. I bought this book in 2012 to try to understand this president.As in real life, in this book Obama give the positive & the negative of the situations/issues he discusses but he never take a position. He cannot make up his mind. If you ever doubted that Barack Obama is full of himself, read this book and doubt no more. This piece of self aggrandizing dribble is pathetic. The tone is pedantic and arrogant throughout. A waste of money if you buy it and a waste of time if you read it to the end. I kept waiting to read something about the real barrack, never did figure out what dreams he got from his father.  I did get how much he hates white people. A roadmap to Obama's failed presidency and the global collapse....We must stop pulling our punches in these dangerous times.America doesn't have the luxury of time to wait out the presidential term of this dangerously dysfunctional president.The synergy of asymmetric warfare, nanosecond systems of global reach, porous borders and a generation disaffected, amoral, programmed and desensitized –savages lying in wait, favors the jihadist.Obama is clearly incapacitated. We cannot compel him to become capable. (Or moral.)And even if we could, he would sabotage any forced effort, witness Afghanistan.  Indeed, witness his latest ISIS head-fake malfeasance.The only rational solution is to remove Obama for incapacity – Section 4 of the 25th Amendment was conceived precisely for this purpose.The political class understands this, yet not one of them seems to have the courage merely to enunciate it.We the people must find a way to remove him. The political class clearly lacks the courage. As do the media. Even Fox. I don't think most of this is true.  How does he know what his fathers dreams were, he only saw him twice in his life. A man full of hate for those that are not like himself (namely whites).  Although this book is disturbing, it is an important read for those that want to understanding the man and the direction he wants to take our country. I felt the book shaped his ideology and perhaps not in the most positive way.I was glad to see he had other family and how large it is. If I hadn't read this book I still wouldn't know the size of his family.The book is long and drudges on and on. I felt it could of been told with fewer words.  If there are any cliff notes, I recommend you stop there. I felt I was reading a story about a Narcissist who was trying to justify how great he thought he was. It could have been about a "Hitler" in the making. I read it to the end and felt so discouraged, knowing this man today. Vacuous, shallow and vague.  I was looking for insight into the man and got pages marked with thoughtless, empty words.  It was ordered so I could see for myself the things I was hearing.  They were there and we are suffering for it now.  The sad thing is there doesn't seem to be a great desire on the part of many the undo what was said would be done. This book has been edited to make Obama look not quite as racist and filled with hate. A little different from the original book. Still a bunch of BS. For some reason the audio book differs from the printed book in that it never mentions the mysterious "Frank" who is such an influence on Obama's life.... could this be because Frank was Frank Marshal Davis, a member of the communist party (Number 47544) who was moved to Hawaii to prepare it for the inevitable "revolution?" How much influence did a communist have on Obama? Apparently a lot since he mentions him so often... in the printed version. While leaving off Frank's last name.I guess the ends justifies the means. If you don't know who that quote is from, ask. I'm sure he knows. once upon a time there was a boy with a terrible father that used race to get what he wanted, which was a dream his father had and passed on to him Terrible book, but you should read it, if only to educate yourself on this imposter that has fooled so many gullible Americans! Too many people are falling for the media hype without really doing any research at all. We want to be "that person"... the one that helps everyone... well, so do I! But not at the expense of the loss of all my country stands for! This man is truly dangerous, and it shows up from WAY before he got into politics... read the book... see for yourself. But if you have a choice, borrow it from someone else. Don't pay for it. Don't give that idiot a penny of your money! Not worth the $1.91 purchase price.  Reads like one of Obama's speaches.  How much of it is truthful?  Who cares? This book is mostly fictional. The events he potrays in this book are mostlyfabricated or ideas or expierences from someone else. Writing is another thing he has no business doing! I think Mr Obama says it best by replacing business with book.I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got best selling bool -- you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen. Before ordering this audiobook, be aware that it has been further abridged to remove all references to 'Frank', Obama's acknowledged 'mentor' and 'role model' and 'second father'..Who was Frank? Frank Marshall Davis- Communist, Pedophile, pornographer...with a 600 page FBI FILE..you don't have to believe me; just google or bing it...further proof that Obama is a fake, fraud and liar...sorry to disapoint all you followers of the 'Obamassiah'. This is the man who apologizes to Islam for our First Amendment Rights in our Constitution, and then edits out incriminating evidence from his own works. There are older, unabridged versions available from used dealers. This book is full of contradictions and inaccuracies.  Many parts don't make sense.  Much of it seems like the imagination of someone who has "delusions of grandeur," thinking themself to be extraordinarily gifted beyond everyone else.  In summary, this book is a load of ****.  . its obvious that he wanted nothing to do with his mothers family from an identity standpoint no matter how well they raised and treated him Bill Ayers, formerly of the famous domestic terrorist group Weather Underground, really did try as hard as he could to add to encapsulate the birth narrative that Barry Soetoro has been pushing for the last decade. Despite Ayers' hard effort, what little proof and documentation we have of Barry's early life through his 30's dispels nearly all of this mediocre piece of fiction. A much better choice if one is seriously interested in this man's upbringing would be the "Dreams from My Real Father" documentary. I found this book not well done.  It was just not well written. It covered material which made people question how he found the money to travel to Kenya. It stirred up other questions. I found the book totally lacking in interest.  Obama's father died and he barely knew his real father. How would he even know the dreams of a man that he barely knew? His father died in a drunk accident. After seeing the movie "2016", I wanted to read the book for myself.  I really have a hard time expressing how I feel after reading it.  I had heard that it might have been written by someone else.  The vocabulary was unlike anything I have heard Obama use, when his words are his own off teleprompter.  Like others, I spent a lot of time scratching my head because there seemed to be little depth to his interactions with others.  It seemed like he spent 3/4 of the book worrying about the fact that he is black/white with no father and mother.  I can understand why Obama does not feel like he should be involved with the black community here, because he has never experienced what they have had to other than not having a father in his life.  The so-called privileged life he lead, and the fact that he jumped from city to city trying to find someone to continue giving him a feel good fix, seems like he wants people to feel sorry for him because he couldn't fit in the way he thought he should be fitting in considering how smart everyone said he was and perfect they told him he was.  The story was light weight, hard to follow, and boring until the Kenyan part.  That'ssad because that part is so short.  After reading the way Obama described how his father and other men in Africa treated their relationships with women (meeting, so called "marrying" them,  having children, and moving on to the next one) seems like the way of the black culture here, few fathers involved with their children.  When Obama says some of the people are composites to save time in the story sounds really weird.  How do you do that?  I would not suggest this book for anything other than to put you to sleep in bed, it did so for me after reading a couple of pages thus taking forever to get through the entire book.  We still know nothing about this composite of a man from Ireland, Hawaii, Chicago, Kenya, and  wherever else.  I wouldn't be surprised if his family turned out to be a composite like his girlfriend in his other book.  But if Ayers wrote this book, and it's as boring as it is, I have no desire to read his book. This bibliography is so sick, I can't even imagine it.  If this is the truth, then all the statements he made in office and all his actions are false. I read this when it was first published and didn't really know what to make of it, or it's main character. Something didn't fit ! I am glad I didn't review this right after reading. As time has unfolded the real Barack Hussien Obama aka Barry Soetoro. He's quite the con man, in fact it turns out that the writer has now been disclosed as Bill Ayers of  Weather Underground terrorist group. The mystery surrounds Obama, college transcripts, Harvard Law review articles (none). This guy is an imposter of the highest order, so is his disgusting wife. The media of course went along for the ride, hiding behind their racist overcoats. Judge a man not by the color of his skin, but the content of his character. Unfortunately nobody knew what Obama's character really was until now. Brian Williams lied all along too. Lying has become a way of life in most parts of the  USA now (except the Conservative party)  and it's a shame. History will judge this Socialist and I hope Americans wake up to this kind. Clintons are worst. The longer this two bit dictator stays in the oval office the more we learn about the man! There is just too much inconsistency in the book (aside from the drug use)which makes the readers head spin. His stepfather never fought the Dutch and was never a pow under the British. This is just one instance. There are several more. This whole book is a lie!!!!Oh yeah, if Amazon does not post this review so much for the First Amendment. Kinda hard to listen to or take advice from someone who's never accomplished anything (besides handing other people's money out).  Most politicians are narcissists, but this one's the poster child.The book was a slow read and I found myself questioning most everything he said, as he's contradicted some of the more reasonable tenets in the book in how he's handled the job he occupies now.  Hypocritical.Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Hard to swallow the "preachy" stuff. Couldn't finish it, I almost puked. But it does shine some light on the thought process of the worst president in our history. This story is obviously fiction.  There is no way events that are presented actually took place in the manner described.  They are presented factually as though he was actually there and he wasn't even born yet, to list just one reason.  Waste of my time other than to get some idea why this man is a racist.  $3.00? This isn't worth 3 cents I REALLY tried to get into this book, but I just could not.  Finally I just gaveup trying to push my way through it. I felt like I was missing any key takeaways or lessons beyond understanding what impact his upbringing might have on the way he views the world. In his new book "Public Enemy," Bill Ayers confesses to being the real author of "Dreams From My Father."  Obama, apparently, has neither the brains  nor the temperament to write his own autobiography.  The publisher should withdraw the book and put the right author on the title page. Where to begin. What do you say about the most destructive president since LBJ? What do you say about the guy who made Bush 43 look not just good, but AWESOME...?I could go on about all the clever tricks used in BO's narcissistic magnum opus; how he proudly proclaims in the first paragraph how he was the first African American editor of the Harvard Law Review, yet leaves out how he was also the first editor to not publish a single article in it. But that's been done. And done. And done. And done.What's missing here, and even in many things produced in reaction to this (eg Dreams From My Real Father:  A Story of Reds and Deception) is a detailed exposition of where BO's leftism actually originated before entering his narcissistic mind. It's not that BO is important; he's just another nobody, like Pol Pot or Hoxha, sitting on the throne, running a country into the ground with socialist policies. What IS actually important here is how American society - including BO and the other 17 year old minds he associates with - has become infected with socialism, which has killed 100 million people in the last century.We know that BO's real paternal figure, and maybe also his biological father (BO's mom was... promiscuous, to say the least) was Frank Marshall Davis, another genius leftist who thought that socialism was the ticket to saving America's oppressed minorities. Keep in mind that this rocket scientist, Frank, was too simplistic to realize that socialism is always racist; it always destroys the weakest elements of society first. Look at apartheid, created in South Africa by white, socialist labor unions, who used it to keep the more skilled, African workers from competing with the whites.Frank's (and Barack's) ideological masters, the Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist Soviets, deported millions to their graves and used methods not seen since the Spanish Inquisition to scare the Russian citizenry into submission during the Red Terror that started in 1917, following the Bolshevik Revolution. People were tortured and terrorized in sick, disgusting ways (eg rolled around in barrels with nails; frozen to death from exposure as they were made into human icicles by water poured on them; burned, boiled, or flayed alive, etc). FYI, the Bolshevik Revolution was NOT a mass revolution; rather, Lenin et al brought in outside mercenaries to take control of Russia, and then used terror to export his revolution.And these are the ideological masters of Barack Obama. They were no more than terrorists and thugs.If you've ever heard BO speak, besides repeating how great he is, you've probably heard something like this -- "That devil, America!"Those devilish Americans, who sacrificed over 400,000 lives to liberate Europe and the camps in WW2; who sponsored the Marshall plan to rebuild Europe; who saved South Korea from the same fate as North Korea after the latter exported its revolution to the South (see Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West to see how North Korea is doing these days); who pulled out of the Kennedy-LBJ war (after losing over 30,000 lives) because of Soviet influence in the far left of American politics, only to watch 2,000,000 innocents then get slaughtered by the communists in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. What do you say about someone who is proudly part of that movement? What do you say about somebody who blames America for all the problems in the world?The bottom line is that you shouldn't care about Barack Obama, because he is a nobody and the left has a million more race-baiting nobodies just like him, lined up and waiting. (Maybe not quite as articulate or handsome, but they are there). Far, far better to understand the source of it all - skip to chapter 33 of Disinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion, and Promoting Terrorism and you will see precisely from where Mr Obama's programming originated.Peace. Back in 2008, I read "Who Wrote Dreams From My Father?" on the 'American Thinker' website.So last summer when I was given a copy of 'Dreams From My Father', I was looking forward to reading it.But, the book was so uninteresting, after a few chapters, I returned it to it's owner.(And it turns out, she had not read it either).My guess is, a lot of liberals have this book laying on their coffee table, unread.If anyone does plan on buying this book, you might want to avoid reading"Who Wrote Dreams From My Father?" By Jack Cashill. It might spoil it for you. Very Poor Book - It's like Obama just doesn't get it - he's still having problems with his identity and I didn't see a conclusion or profound thought in it.  I don't think it was worth publishing. If people knew all these things about Obama, he would never have been voted  as president of the United States.  I believe everyone should read this book before the election in November 2012. My GOD how did a moron like this get to be president?..First 6 years of school was in a Muslim school( he wasnt even raised in America)...both parents were MARXIST...his father was a drunk womanizer who had kids by three women and killed a man...his mother was sexually promiscuous America hater who dragged OBAMA all over the world chasing her men...she even got mad at one husband for starting a business that actually made a profit. His Grandparents were far left loons who raised him in a "church" that had communists on the board of deacons...his "black" mentor in Hawaii was a leader in the local communist party. Obama himself hated America to the point he wouldnt even wear an American flag on his lapel till it looked like the liberal media was going to MAKE him President.  He had years in school he claimed were just a haze because of his Drug habits. And he wont even release his college grades because everyone will see he only made it thru affirmative action. The people that support trash like OBAMA need to get OUT OF MY COUNTRY NOW. If a second revolution comes like I think it will..we will run you out of it anyway...like we did the first group of TORIES in the first revolution. Sorry story. Joel Gilbert's "Dreams From My REAL Father" is more accurate.  This is a fairy tale to deceive.  Obama didn't even write this.  Wish this was a true story but it's not.Barack Obama is the son of Frank Marshall Davis (a communist and sexual deviant) and Stanley Ann Dunham, (see porno pictures of her above mentioned book).Obama's Harvard education was funded by Saudi Arabia.Dreams From My Father is Barack's fantasy of the beginnings he wishes he had had and explains why he is the way he is.  The worst piece of trash I have ever read. In 2014 we find out that this is not an autobiography, but rather a work of fiction authored by Bill Ayers. It skips around constantly with no consistant thought. He talks about a man that he " thinks" may be his father, a mother who may or may not have been married to this man because there is no marriage cert, only a divorce cert and no one remembers attending or being there. A boy who falls from a tree and is permanantly injured to the point of a limp and yet becomes president without the limp. A mother who removes her son from her passport but no explanations as to why. It makes you wonder more if he is a product of identity theft rather then a true story. Everything is imagined. His father is a guess, his mother, his illigitimacy, his sister who was a child housemade, dying the week she comes out saying that she doesn't think the American president is the boy she knew as Barack Obama II. even his name. Barry which is easier said, coincidentally the same name he uses later as a college student Barry Soetoro, the same name as his " stepfather" an indonesian muslim. It makes you wonder if Soetoro is his bio father and that is the true cover up.The whole story just flits aorund like a liar in a police interogation. No consistancy, no truth. The man is a good actor though and his deep voice is mezmerizing, almost hypnotic.Unless you want to read fiction about your president, don't waste your money. Utter and total garbage and the publisher should be sued for misrepresenting it as a true story. This book bored me to tears. Just like the man himself. My wife bought this book - not because she like Obama.  Rather, she wanted to know where his crazy ideas come from.  She read a chapter or two before her BS detector stopped her from reading any further. The content within this book has been proven untrue, this is not about Obama's family or his life.  The girlfriend in the book doesn't even exist, the story having to do with the theater and they argument he said they had never happened.  The magazine he claimed to have seen about the black man dyeing his skin out of shame was not true and the article doesn't even exist.  From beginning to end the book is not about his life or his family, it is a collection of fairy tales and should not be taken seriously. This book is OK, I suppose it would be better if I believed any of it. I won't go into how terribly unreadable this story is.  To say that oboomba had any life challenges whatsoever and wasn't, in fact, advanced through life solely based on his family connections and skin color is moronic.  I know people want to read this and think that he actually earned a modicum of what he is, but unfortunately, that just isn't true.I won't go into the fact that he's writing books when he should be trying to turn our county's economy and foreign policy around.  By sheer luck, oboomba has advanced race relations in our country though, even the most hardcore racists hate oboomba because he's an idiot, not because he's black. If the entire country had listened to this book before the 2008 election, he wouldn't have ever even been on the ticket. The democrats could have had Hillary Clinton as President and maybe something to brag about. Instead, the entire world has this loser as adequatley described in his own words. Get this book and pass it around ASAP. Really a big lie ducked with all the STORIES Arrogant..... self serving and not worth the paper it is printed on.  It was a waste of money to me. Painfully boring!  It was so bad I couldn't finish reading it, and I love to read. I really decided I don't want to know what made Obama the kind of man that he turned out to be. He is destroying the U.S. "IF I HAD A SON, HE'D LOOK LIKE BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA!"-SATAN-The racist part about how "If things get ugly, I'll stand with the criminal moslems against Whitey!" nailed it for me! Oh Lord where do I start? First off, this book wasn't even written by Hussein Obama. Second, the kenyan man named Obama is not his real father. Thirdly, his REAL father is Frank Marshall Davis a known and self avowed communist sympathizer. His mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, was a "snow bunny" liberal who slept around with various black men possibly as a jab at her parents and rebellious youth she was pushing along in. She was seduced by Davis, who then slept with her, knocked her up with a bastard child (aka- Barack Hussein Obama, aka- Barry Soetero, aka- various other names with fake SSNs in States he never resided in) who then was taken to Indonesia where he was registered into school as "Barry Soetero" and a "muslim" who then returned to America with his mother and obtained student loans under a "foreign student" program. He's basically a living breathing definition of a "charlatan" (liar).He's the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the American People this side of the Federal Reserve. This book really deserves zero stars. This book, along with the Audacity of Hope, should have given a fair warning to the American people about Barack Hussein Obama's far-left agenda. Sadly, though, it was ignored and with the help of the far-left media we got this radical elected. You asked for it, America, and you got it. Read this book and you will clearly see his communist and racist agenda for our nation. Next time, before you get wrapped up into "YES WE CAN!", do your homework, America! Romney in 2012! He's not the best, but he is the only hope this country has for this year. We must fire Barack Hussein Obama. And Amazon, don't you even think about deleting this review like you did for my review for the Audacity of Hope. This is relevant for the book and you've already made enough left-wing political statements to the public. A silly book, bragging about things that he dreams, as if they happened. Maybe unlike Clinton, he just didnt EX-hale.Looking at the reviews here, I see people fawn all over him, and NEVER READ THE BOOK.I got to chapter five before I realized I should be reading the ACA...because not ONE democrat in congress read it.I wonder if obama will read THIS book someday. just bought it for the quotes .... Worst I ever read. Don't waste your money. Mr. Obama did not write his book.  Bill Ayers, his good friend, the domestic terrorist from Hyde Park, IL, did.  Obama isn't that deep of a thinker (perhaps the continued drug use in his college years addled his brain...?), though this Dictator in Chief IS an ideologue, pushing his radical leftist agenda, as taught to him by personal mentors like communist leader Frank Marshall Davis, who is the "Frank" Obama refers to in this book.  The mark of other radical leftists, like the Marxist Saul Alinsky (who wrote "Rules for Radicals"), can also be found as strong influences on Obama's tactics of distraction to accomplish agendas ("never let a crisis go to waste") as well his strong hatred for American tradition, our Constitution, and moral codes of ethics.  (With a man who lies with as much frequency as Mr. Obama, what morals or ethics does he have worth keeping??)  Anyway, don't waste your time reading this.  If people haven't been living under a rock, or on drugs, or been wearing rose-colored liberal glasses for the last 7 years, they'll KNOW what harm to America, that Barack Obama is about.  ANY person, esp. a Commander In Chief, who would endanger Americans by releasing illegal aliens with multiple criminal convictions on their record (including rape & murder) rather than deporting these criminals,  is NOT a responsible, good person, and can be considered, rightfully, an enemy of our republic.  America has lost so much liberty, so much traditions, so much goodness, since this buffoon has taken office in the White House.  BTW, I notice that the Obama toilet paper has more reviews than does this "Dreams" book, and most of them positive.  Seems that not everyone is fooled by this charlatan. A look inside the mind of a godless liar and how he became the thing he is today. Tells the truth about our leadership and why we have had the worst 6 years in the history of this country. An inherited trail of lies and deceit have been expounded on the citizens of this country.  Not that interesting.  I thought I had read it before but it was totally different. Uh, oh.  Economy shrunk in Q1 of 2015.  This is a disaster.  There is no recovery going on. Welfare is at all-time highs. 93 million American adults are out of work, many displaced by illegal aliens. Our 30% corporate tax is #1 highest in the world and is a job-killer from the word go. Debt is soaring to levels that our unborn grandchildren cannot hope to repay. Our transition to socialism is bleeding our freedoms dry. Rigged 0 percent interest rates have sparked a false, speculative bubble in stocks and luxury homes and Ferraris because the rich have no other place to invest.And now, unlike in 2008, there are no more big government financial resources to do either a bailout or "stimulus" so when we tank again, it's going to be really ugly.  Baltimore ugly.God, are we now in trouble. I think Obama is mentally ill not to see this carnage. Nothing to say Another piece of crap that blows your mind. Enough Said ! Obama didn't write this book; at least not all of it. Check out 'Deconstructing Obama.' The similarities between Ayres' writing and what we are TOLD is Obama's prose are far too great to be coincidental. waste of money. tells nothing.....proves nothing. Thought i might learn something about his odd behavior but to no avail. Save your money and read something worth it. Stupid book by a stupid man President Barack Obama is an Islamist who is intentionally working against the security of the United States, said former Florida Rep. Allen West."The only plausible explanation for many actions taken by President Obama and his administration is that they are working counter to the security of the United States of America," the retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel wrote in a post on his website on Wednesday.West cited the president's decision to release five senior Taliban members in the exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl; supplying weapons to support the Egyptian government led by the Muslim Brotherhood; and negotiating with Hamas.He also criticized Obama's decision to suspend a ban on Libyans attending U.S. flight schools and studying nuclear science, which had been in place since 1983."Can anyone explain what the strategy and objective is here in lifting this ban with a nation that is or should be on the terrorist watch list?" West wrote."Sorry, but I can only explain this one way: Barack Hussein Obama is an Islamist in his foreign policy perspectives and supports their cause."He added, "The pivot away from the Middle East seems to be nothing more than an opportunity to enable Islamists and their goals. Anyone supporting this Libyan ban being lifted is indeed an enemy of this state." Why bother reading a book supposedly written by Obama which in fact was NOT written by himAn IMPOSTOR!The book in itself is very well written and not at the level of Obama  Filled with lies! Dreams From My Father - A Story Of Race And Inheritance, Revised EditionYou would not think this book could have been written by a person that has become the President of the country that he so vehemently despises.It's more of a manifesto to destroy what he believes to be evil. I purchased this book to compare it to the original book. The original book written by Obama was rewritten, the rewrite than became a copy right and to buy an original is very costly if you can find it. Writing an autobiography at 30 years old '''' I couldn't find anything worth a flip , this book is a waste of time and money Prevarication personified. Pure vomit, spewed from the mouth and ghost writer of the biggest fraud in American History. This is the sad story of a young boy whose polygamist father knocked up his mother, then left her with a baby in arms while he ran off to Boston to marry yet another woman then left that woman behind to rejoin wife #1 back in Kenya.  This conceited loser thought he deserved an important position in the Kenyan government.  When his superiors disagreed, he become an alcoholic and drank himself to death.  Barrack met this man only once, when he revisited Hawaii during Barrack's tween years and when he berated the poor child to work harder at school(between visits to the local bars).Barrack did not want to believe that this loser didn't care about his abandoned wife and son and so contrived his silly and pathetic tale that he only abandoned Barrack because of the important work he was doing.It would just be a sad tale, except that the "important work" was bringing a Communist government to Kenya, and this dream father has inspired Barrack to do the same to this country.Our dead economy is the result of this childhood delusion.  It is a very sad tale. OTHER THEN THE CONTENT THE BOOK IS FINE. I DO NOT ADHERE TO THE "MUSLIM" - "SOCIALIST" PHILOSOPHIES SO HIS POSITIONS ON ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO MY CHILDREN AND GRAND CHILDREN ARE IN STARK OPPOSITION TO HIS VIEWS AND BACKGROUND !! Obama has demonstrated his disdain for truth with his disgusting lies about ObamaCare.His promises of transparency in his administration, clear communication on all topics, and his many lies about ObamaCare make this man incapable of telling us the truth.A much better book/DVD is Dreams of My Real Father which I find much more believable.We know little or nothing about this pol.In the years in which he has been president we don't know anything about his undergraduate time (as a foreign student) or his years in law school. We have not been told why he and Michelle surrendered their licenses to practice law.It was amazing that so many Americans ( living and dead) voted for the worst ( and perhaps the last) president of our republic.Obama feels that everything should be done by the government and is leading us directly to Socialism. A communist manifesto for the new generation, Do yourself a favor and save your money and buy the original... deserves zero stars After reading this book, I am convinced that we must do everything in our power to elect Mitt Romney as our next president. How Obama got elected in the first place is the fault of the national media for not doing its homework and exposing this fraudulant person. May God help us!  THIS IS A REWRITE WITHOUT TELLING THE READERS JUST WHAT HE CHANGED IN THE REWRITE. This book is just like everthing surrounding this imposters life, lies! In the book it's okay for him to make up stuff as if it were real, he is completely incompetent but does have a masterful imagination. Should stick to fiction. Too wordy. His sentences ramble on and on and on, changing subjects and stuffing in as many big words as he can. I had much more respect for him before I read the book. I am sure he has a lot of valuable insight to share I just wish he could get over himself so I could stop falling asleep throughout the book. Although originally published in 1995, this book has a new forward by then US Senator Obama and was republished in 2005. Of course, there is a second book by Senator Obama, and his record in his political campaigns and office holding, especially the campaign for US President and his words and actions in office that are part of the mosaic, and this book can no longer be reviewed as a stand alone of the person who originally wrote it in the 1990's. This review is intended to be read first, before my review of The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream (Vintage), his second book, is read. One should read these two books in that order also. In this post-9/11 world, both what is said and what is not said are equally telling. Before proceeding, every reviewer should know that I have spent over 9,000 hours studying Islam since 9/11. It was an epiphany for me. I have studied the political ideology of Islam, i.e. how Islamic beliefs and actions have affected and do affect folks while on this earth. I have not, and do not care to, study, in any depth, what I consider to be the purely religious aspects of Islam. I have put together, edited, over 3,500 pages of documentation, written over 300 pages myself, and am working on over 1,000 pages more, titled AMERABIA, about the mortal danger the USA is in of becoming an Islamist nation, in whole or in parts, well before 2100, with Michiganistan becoming the first state in the union with first a functional Islamist majority, and then an absolute majority, that will replace our MI Constitution with Sharia Law. Some members of the United States House of Representatives Anti-Terrorism Caucus, 122 members, 40 Democrats, including Rep. Sue Myrick, the Chair of the Caucus, have copies of my documentation on their credenza, and refer to the future of America by my title. The Qur'an has far more and far worse hatred of Jews, both quantitatively and qualitatively, than Mein Kampf, and the Prophet Muhammad makes Hitler seam like the nicest person you would ever want to know and have as your neighbor, as Muhammad was a prophet who was not like Jesus, but like Attila the Hun or Genghis Khan.. Islam is the single bloodiest political ideology that ever stalked this planet, killing more non-Muslims that the entire 20th century killed in total, including all those killed in war. Our own Muslims here in Michigan want Sharia Law to replace our Constitution and are having 8 or more babies per family. We also call it Dearbornistan for darn good reasons. Islam is not a race, as most Muslims are not Arabs, and there are wonderful, peaceful Christian and Jewish Arabs. Muslims can believe that Islam is a religion, but that does not mean that the rest of us should be so ignorant and believe that. Yes, there are peaceful Muslims, but will they actively oppose the Jihadists? Iraq and Afghanistan will slide backwards so fast it will make our heads spin. Will "peaceful" Muslims oppose the imposition of Sharia law? The answer in Europe and America, as well as Islamist lands, is no. England, Russia, Austria, and perhaps some other European countries, plus Canada and some South American countries, will have Islamist majorities around the middle of this century, and will be almost totally Islamist before the end of this century. Whether one calls it WW III, and whether that occurs before, during or after our own 2nd Civil War, we, the USA, are in mortal danger of becoming an Islamist country also, albeit, not demographically, at least initially. Islam is a patriarchal belief set. Muslim men may marry non-Muslim women, as Obama's dad did with his mother. Muslim Women are not allowed to marry non-Muslim men, but in dar al-Harb (a non-Islamic land, or, more literally, the Land of War), Muslim Women are pushed to marry some non-Muslim men in order to lie to them about how Islam is a "Religion of Peace" and influence them to allow Islamists to take over the country from the inside out. A great example is Grover Norquist, whose wife, Samah, from "Palestine" represents the view that Hamas, Fatah, and Hezbollah are all peaceful folks that we should snuggle up to. In dar al-Islam, or an Islamist country, such as Egypt, no Coptic Christian male is allowed to even date a Muslim woman, and Coptic Christians have been killed for doing so, as have Christians and non-Muslims in all Islamic countries throughout history. Obama admits that his dad is a Muslim. He admits that his Mom is an atheist. He admits that his step-dad is a Muslim. It is all quite understated. Because Obama's dad was a Muslim, he is a Muslim, until or unless he converts to a different religion, no matter how "secular" and "non-practicing" he is. He lived in a Muslim majority country (95%), Indonesia, for over 4 years. Per this book, he attended two schools, one a local school and one an "International" (Catholic/Christian) school for two years each. That he was registered at both schools as a Muslim is not in this book, nor is that he attended religion classes in both schools, both on Islam, since he was registered as a Muslim. Obama has said that he cut up in class. I'm sure he did some of the time. I'm also sure he was taught the little kid version of Islam. In addition, he also attended Mosque from time to time, although he initially denied that during his campaign for President. This documentation regarding his registration, etc, is from Daniel Pipes (head of the MEF), who has photos of the original registrations and curricula, and has done original research. I lived overseas for almost 3 1/2, years, graduating from high school at the International School of Brussels (Belgium). My experience in Western Europe was extremely different from Obama's. I learned, very differently, that America is the finest country in the world, that it is a Shining City on a Hill, while Obama has very mixed reviews about America and Americans in this book. I also learned that kids the age of Obama (6-10) in foreign lands only learn the little kid version of the culture they live in, which, regarding Islam, is entirely inappropriate, and irrelevant, in a grown up world. There are indications that the little kid version lives on in Obama, but there are also open questions about whether he has also learned the adult version, and is practicing taqqiya (the mainstream Islamist practice and teaching that lying to non-Muslims about who you are, your beliefs and values; and to hide and disguise the true nature of Islam from all non-Muslims is approved and commanded). "She taught me to disdain the blend of ignorance and arrogance that too often characterized Americans abroad" (p47). So I, as an American abroad, my Dad, my Mom, my brothers and sister, my friends and the hundreds of Americans I knew were ignorant and arrogant? It takes an ignorant and arrogant person to make such a baldly false statement, but that is the kind of pap and pablum Obama was fed by his Mom; and that he bought into. Most Americans overseas were middle class businessmen, trying to do their best to earn a living, make their companies successful, and raise their families as Americans in a non-American environment. From all of the Belgian friends I had, all I can say is that the "ugly American" is mostly a myth. At best those that might be characterized as "ugly", as there are some in every nationality, were far and few between. There are numerous books written that take Obama to task for his associations with disreputable and questionable characters, both explained in this book and otherwise. I will pass on those aspects, and concentrate on the Islamist aspects of this book. Obama admits to admiring Malcolm X, as a Muslim. That's not fine, as Malcolm X was the leading edge of the mainstreaming of Black American Muslims into the Wahhabi and Islamist fold, as Louis Farrakhan, and his blatant, open, anti-semitism display today. "Regina was on her way to Andalusia...". (p.116) This seeming casual statement is another indicator of how Obama is steeped in Islamist beliefs and propaganda. Andalusia refers to Spain when it was Islamist. Jihadists refer to Spain as Andalusia to ensure that everyone knows that it was once theirs, and they intend to take it back. Andalusia also refers to the myth of a "golden age" of peaceful Islam in Spain. As Reza Aslan, author of "No God but God" states, there was no such golden age. From the numerous books and articles I have read, plus the knowledgeable scholars I have talked to. I concur with Aslan (which I usually don't). In 1066AD, at the height of the alleged "Golden age", the Jews in Cordoba peacefully spoke out and demonstrated against the imposition of Sharia Law and their status as "dhimmi", or "kafirs", 2nd class, semi-slaves. The Jews thought the Muslims had "moderated". Oops! The "peaceful" Muslims slaughtered 5,000 of them for daring to speak out. "Andalusia is a myth. But this is part of Obama's totally fabricated belief set, which affects his actions as President. Obama had a Pakistani for a roommate between Oxy and Harvard, to the best of trying to divine what this book states. Obama has subsequently admitted that he went to Pakistan for two weeks with his roommates (plural). Maybe these were nice folks, but they were Muslims, and Pakistan is not the spring break garden spot, it is one of the worlds greatest hotbeds for the Jihadists. Obama has never stated who he met, what they talked about, and what he did in Pakistan. Maybe it is all innocent. But why has Obama not fully disclosed what happened? This is germaine  to who he is and what he has done as President. On pp 183 -184 he rants against civilization, industrialization, and capitalization. In short, he believes that factories that are set up in foreign lands destroy the ability of the natives to live of off the land as their parents did, and when the factories close, the workers are left helpless. Without going into the details of this argument, which I disagree with, he includes the West Bank as one of the regions that was so devastated. There is zero truth to that statement. There is no documentation to back up that statement. It is a total fabrication, but it is part of the Islamist apologist belief set, just as is the belief that Israel and the US government knocked down the twin towers on 9/11, which the Muslims in Flint still teach in their maddrassah. Ultimately:FACT: Obama was a Muslim, by Islam's rules, when he was born.FACT: Obama stayed a Muslim until, or unless, he converted to another religion, by  Islam's rules.FACT: Obama was a Muslim at least until he was 27, when he purportedly converted to  Black Liberation Theology in Reverend Wright's Church. Once again, Islam's  own rules, no matter how secular and non-practicing he appears to be.FACT: The penalty, by Islam's own rules, for apostasy, leaving Islam, as an adult, is  death. Numerous Islamists should be foaming at the mouth at the chance to fulfill  Muhammad's commandment.. One normally converts from one major religion to another for a reason, such as the new religion is more attractive, but when converting away from Islam, it is also normally because one has found out the truth about the horrors of Islam. Obama still snuggles up to Islamist beliefs, so should anyone believe he has converted? Or is he practicing taqqiya, as Islam teaches, promotes, and allows? The rest of the story is only told in his second book and his actions as a US Senator and as President. Completely stupid book that glorifies socialism in its worse form. I was shocked to see the lack of education on Obamas part. WOW. Purchased it only as a gag gift.  Recipient laughed and promised that it would hit the trash within three days. only bought it to review his Loyalty to the muslims Worthless piece of racist propaganda. poorly written This book is poorly done. Spend your time reading something better. It was hard to even get through this but I did because I wanted to like it.  Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance by Barack Obama"I ceased to advertise my mother's race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so, I was ingratiating myself to whites."Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance by Barack Obama"I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race."Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance by Barack Obama"There was something about her that made me wary, a little too sure of herself, maybe and white."Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance by Barack Obama"It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names."Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance by Barack Obama"I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn't speak to my own. It was into my father's image, the black man, son of Africa ,that I'd packed all the attributes I sought in myself: the attributes of Martin, Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela."And FINALLY......and most scary:The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream (Vintage) by Barack Obama"I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an 'ugly direction'." I can't say that I found this to be life changing. Self-serving would be more appropriate. For someone whom has a deep affiliation and so called understanding of Kenyans, I find it hard to believe that there was not and has not been a mention of aparteid. Watch The Rising Son if you need a reminder.  Not only is there poverty and socialist ideals, there are grand scale MURDERS. Self absorbed BS just goes to show you how racist our president is and how much of a drug addict/alchoholic he is.He is a communist by his own admission and he never says he graduated Columbia. Mostly a bunch of lies but does show the real reason behind Obama's wild departure from our Constitution. He is totally mad at the United States. False advertising on T.V.  It was mostly about white racism and none of the dreams of "His Father"  He called his father the "old man." Purchased for a friend to show long range plan of Obama to downgrade American standard of living based on dreams from his African father. This is typical shameless garbage that the criminal elite use to promote themselves and their underlings. And don't be ridiculous and think that slick BHO even wrote this book. None of our phoney, criminal, deviant, controlled "leaders" ever write any of the shameless books that are attributed to them. Why do we continue to be so naive and foolish? Why do we continue to think that we live in any sort of democracy?What can be said for sure about BHO is that he is an attractive man who can spew forth what is written for him in an eloquent manner. Oh, and he has nice white teeth. That's it folks, and I could care less what Oprah and all those little Hollywood turds gush about him, because BHO is a manufactured cut-out of a candidate who will be completely controlled by all the usual suspects. But, don't think just anyone could do what BHO does. He has a small army of helpers creating his image, dressing him, booking teeth whitening appointments, and white washing his past - especially on the internet. He has obviously had quite a bit of training in public speaking, but not just the "normal" type that you and I might sign up for. No, no. What he's been well trained in (as was Clinton, Reagan, and many others) is neurolinguistic programming (NLP) and subtle hypnotic/subliminal speech patterns. Of course it also helps a great deal that everywhere he speaks is "specially wired" for sound, which affects the audience in ways they probably couldn't comprehend or believe. This type of frequency manipulation of brain waves and body rhythms has been perfected for well over 2 decades. But, that's getting off topic...Anyways, the amount of misdirection, inconsistency, undocumented statements / claims, and total shameless introspective pyscho mish-mash in this book is gut wrenching (in a bad way). But for a sane person searching for the truth, here are some questions to ponder: where was his father born in reality? how many wives / offspring did he have? as a "poor goat farming" family, how did he get the expensive initial education that he did? what are the connections to the Ford Foundation and the Rockefellers? where was BHO's mother born and why is there no records for the first 10 years of her life? if she was schooled in Lebanon initially, why? why can't the BHO Team produce a birth certificate from the State of Hawaii if he was born there? why did the BHO Team finally release a "document of live birth" that was shown to be a forgery? where was BHO born then? why was BHO's "maternal grandfather" working for the Rockefellers? why is there essentially no evidence that BHO went to Columbia University and why does he refuse to release transcripts in order to prove it? what is the connection of Indonesia to BHO really? And these are just a few questions a great researcher by the name of Don Nicoloff brings up in his writings for the Idaho Observer.Here's my personal take: BHO is part of an elite group of underlings with Rockefeller connections whom the real Controllers choose from to do their biddings. His real family tree has been obscured, as has his early childhood, and his "resume" has been grossly fluffed up to say the least, but these are common themes within the group of elite underlings. Two general statements that can be said about all elite underlings (and they apply to BHO of course) are they have connections - Rockefeller at least, but also Israel, and they have a variety of "hooks" in them. "Hooks" are things that create shame and fear and allow for blackmail, control, and sometimes extortion. All elite underlings have similar "hooks", and these are sexual deviance (homosexuality and usually pedophilia), hard core drug use, criminal financial activity, and (believe it or not) some sort of connection to Satanic / esoteric / occult rituals and rites. Now, having said that, BHO could have been chosen to be some CEO, or Congressman, or Supreme Court Judge, or high level military man, or International banker, or Ambassador, or even major Hollywood player by the Controllers, but obviously it was decided (probably due to his skin color, good looks, and ability to master those special public speaking protocols) that he could take a run at the Presidency. Then among the Controllers, Brzezinski obviously won the rights to be BHO's puppet handler and direct him in agendas only the criminal elite can fathom. But, don't think that McCain doesn't have his connections, hooks, and handler also, because he has. This is the System that actually exists, but the sheeple dream of democracy and read books like this because they want to have hope, believe in ideals, and delay dealing with reality. In this sense, the book is brilliantly titled in an ironic, double meaning sort of way. sad man I am an undecided voter and decided to read this book hoping to gain some valuable insight on the presidential nominee. I did gain some insight, that for all his education, he hasn't learned to look beyond skin color. Want change? Read this book, it will change the way you look at Obama. I am biracial and I do not struggle with it, I am proud to be ALL that I am. The color of my skin is not who I am. I do not want a President who only sees the world in black & white. If  The Audacity of Hope was obama's Manifesto, then this piece of birdcage material is his Mein Kampf.From his abandonment as a mixed-race child to his days as Barry Soetoro in Muslim school to the days 'on his knees to please' in front of rich, old White men in Hawaii in exchange for drugs to his homosexual relationships in college and currently, this narcissist weaves a fictional tale of woe and struggle that leaves the critical thinker wondering "What happened to Frank Marshall Davis"?Only the most delirious sycophant of the obama myth could consider this piece of fiction enlightening or entertaining.It should be listed in the fiction section.  Period.  This is the most racist piece of garbage I have ever attempted to read. Pathetic. Poorly written, haphazard, jumpy, little of interest, scary Purchased as a summer school required reading for my daughter. Barack Obama is an NUT!For instance his dogs name is BO short for Barack Obama right?Another thing when will this yellow bellied chicken liver show his face at The Olympics?I read the listing Kings Presidents only one Secretary of State this man is not American This man hates America!I have yet to see this character salute the flag I have het to see this scoundrel stand and place his right hand over his heart when the Star Spangled Banner is sung.Oh I forgot he is Wrong Wing which means this jerk salutes the flag with his wrong hand!If you ate considering this book DO NOT TOUCH IT!!!!!!!Rather read a book of a man who loved His country by the name Ronald Reagan sure he made a few mistakes none to major he loved America read The Reagan Diaries or An American Life!Not this trashy book he probably paid his daughters to write a book about Grandpa Obama!Thank you oh yes if you want to read a booon a modern day President read A Charge to Keep by George W. Bush he was not afraid to support America at the Olympics he did not send Condoleezza Rice there he went there he showed us American Citizens thag fear itself is the only thing to fear not hiding under blankets and sucking thumbs hoping your secretary of  state comes home in one piece If Barack Obama hates America this much he should have sent nobody there!Thank you for taking the time to read this review I hope you found it helpful!If not leave a commment and I would love to discuss your problems with you! Horrible. this is another exmple of the fascist pig barack hussein obamas socialist anticonstitutional manifestos. to quote one of the greatest men alive. my cold dead hands. thats where my guns will remain for life. we â¬killâ¬ must â¬barackâ¬ remember â¬obamaâ¬ we â¬nowâ¬ have the power to dethrone dear leader within all of us we are the power that is now able to correct this mistake. my fellow patriots unite. uncle ted your awesome my favorite role model. keep preaching the word of truth an justice. the us constitution protects us we must use it now. rise up and overthrow this usurper. freedom. get this illegal alien out of office. If you wrote a book, you didn't get there on your own. You didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well it must be because I was so smart. They are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder on the book than anybody else. Let me tell you something, they are a lot of hard-working writers out there. If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help (to correct the mistakes for example). There was a great teacher somewhere in your life (maybe not, in fact the reason you needed somebody to correct the spelling mistakes is because you went to a failed public school. Somebody Somebody helped create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive (no not the founding fathers but super LBJ. And before LBJ? Blank out) Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you wrote a book (and sold it on Amazon) you didn't write that. Somebody else made that happen. The internet didn't get invented on his own. Government research created the internet so that all the companies could make profit out of the internet. (Journalist: Was Amazon standing on the side line with the idea of selling stuffs online but with no way of getting online? And was google waiting for the internet to develop with the idea of having a tool to search the internet? Obama: you are not part of the mainstream media, you? Journalist: I told you I was a journalist and I meant it. But anyway, I thought the internet was created by the government for the purpose of defense, not for businesses? Obama: Yeah but we don't use bayonets and horses any longer. Journalist: Actually we do) Check out new DVD "Dreams from My Real Father".  It chronicles Obama's life in socialism, and starts with making the case that Communist Frank Marshall Davis was Obama's biological father.` Fiction at its worst. Raised by devout communists and race baitors, only a country bent on self destruction would elect such an angry small man President Barak Obama is a master of disguise. He is definitely the most dishonest US President this country has ever had. This book reveals the audacity he has lived his life by. What a fraud!  It's too bad that he has admitted to having "composites" in this book. For those of you who don't understand what that is, it means some of it never happened. One of them is when he talks about his mom being called stanley steamer when she was a kid. Stanley Steamer didn't become that until the 1970's. His mom was a kid in like the fifties. I digested the audio version of Dreams From My Father.Whatever lead the author to writing the book years ago, the language and style of the potpourri of its stories tell me that he went out of his way to dazzle the reader and condition the reality to serve his ambitions.There is no clear message in the book that would support Mr. Obama's choice of its title, nor did I find any clear message in it whatsoever.I would also tike to add, in light of the author's current bid for presidency, that the book does not support his claims to being a uniter and an enthusiast for change.  The book does, it seems to me, support my preconceived notion of Mr. Obama as a slick man, craving attention and power, and jostling to get as high as he can in order to validate and glorify himself.  Indeed, had I believed prior to listening to Dreams From My Father Mr. Obama to be a person passionate about change, uniting America, bettering the lot of her poor and underprivileged (including those in the hoods of South Chicago), I would have almost certainly be dissuaded now by, among other, the author's nauseating use in the book of big words, high-flown language, and labored poetic imagery.Jacob Roginsky This was one book you can definitely speed read, because there is a lot of fluff within the pages. Does it give you a lot of insight about Barack Obama? Not Really. You do begin to understand where Barack Obama's class warfare comes from especially between the African-American community and the White community. Barack Obama associates with characters that are pessimistic and angry. You also can't help but believe Obama is sucked into this world too.In one chapter, he talks about change, but he never says what he wants to change, he just wants to change. This narrative of course remains the same. He still talks of change but no one can figure out what he wants to change. He even admits he doesn't know what he is talking about when he says, "There wasn't much detail in the idea."In the chapter he talks of change was during Reagan's tenure. He talks of Reagan, his minions and his dirty deeds. He wants change during a time of great change for the better. Reagan was responsible for creating optimism after the inept Carter years. Obama talks about change in the mood of the country. This period was a very optimistic time in American history. Reagan was responsible for ending the cold war without firing a shot, lowering interest rates from double digits, and creating an unprecedented economic boom.  He also won almost every state in the union. I don't get it. What is it that Obama wanted to change?When Obama listens to the "The Audacity of Hope" speech, he sees himself in this world of pessimism and despair. But, Obama's world was nothing like that. Obama never lacked for anything. This is the dichotomy of Obama's world. He lived a life between the privileged and the middle class, and he went to the top universities, but he envisions himself in John Kerry's two America's where he is one of the have-nots scratching his way to the top.God help us all if Obama becomes the next president. If anyone still has any doubts that this guy is so full of himself and drunk on power read this book. He totally forgets that he is half white and throws his Caucasian relatives under the bus. Many people think he is a cool, calm character, but I think he is like a deer in the headlights that doesn't know what to do. Makes me wonder how long he can keep his smoke and mirrors act going. His house of cards can't stand for much longer. If you can get past the abominably poor language and grammar, composite characters, changed names, dramatized events, and fictionalized dialogue, your reward is...a tedious, overwrought, melodramatic, self-serving memoir about nothing from a 34-year old dilettante.  Whether your politics place you on the left or right, the fact is DREAMS FROM MY FATHER is a clumsy, amateurish effort with little insight and even less truth, and it probably would have been more compelling and weighty had Obama waited until later in his life, after he actually accomplished something, to reflect on and write about his formative experiences.  In contrast to the image propagated by mythologizers in his campaign and elements of the media, Obama demonstrates little skill as a writer and his work here falls far short of publication quality.  DREAMS FROM MY FATHER shows that it's probably best for Obama that he didn't pursue a career as an author, though inarguably not so for the country. Stupid This book explains a lot of why things are turning out the way they are under his presidency. He's putting personal ideology and feelings above what's best for the country. I never bought this product... Not sure why it shows up on my feedback page... I went into this with an open mind.  The result was not pretty:  In this book, Obama vows to embrace his black half and denounce his white half.  That is unquestionably racist and contradicts his promise to be the "Great Unifier."  That was profoundly upsetting, yet wonderfully revealing.  More people should read this book.  They wouldn't be so enamored of His Majesty.  It was also disturbing to learn that his exalted father, whom he admires and adores, lost his legs driving drunk and subsequently died driving drunk.  Daddy Obama also fathered eight children with four women and at one point was married to three of them at the same time.  He abandoned Barrack.  Mommy and her parents raised the future president.  Perhaps Obama should re-think that race preference thing.  And there's sooo much more.  This book tells you what Obama really is... in his own words.  Read it and weep for the country. Sadly, it now seems that Mr. Obama had the book ghost written by neighbor Bill Ayers.  Christopher Andersen's new book Barack and Michelle: Portrait of an American Marriage due out soon says that Michelle said when the deadline was approaching Barrack shipped his files and tapes out to Bill Ayers to write the book.His creditability would have been enhanced by admitting this upfront just as many, many famous "authors" do.  It was a Socialist screed. Should be reclassified as an autofabrication.A total set of lies of an empty life by an empty suit.Made it all up.The man is a hoax. This book doesn't warrant even being published - it's a waste of money, and have found out that it is all lies. I loved "The Audacity of Hope".  When Obama was elected, I was delighted.  I was so disappointed in this book.  I was disappointed in the bad language coming from the mouth of our President.  I listened to the book on audio and had to stop.  I know it's the "real world", but I might be a Republican now. ever wanted your intelligence assumed to be zero? ever wanted to read a bill ayers book? have nothing better to do than support a fraud? this is your book. Anyone who voted for this man should be ashamed of themselves!  He is ruining our country with his racist, communist crap. Sick, twisted and full of buffoon ignorant statements .. Quotes from this book. Talented? Eloquent? Complex? Inspiring? Come on people wake up before it is too late.'I ceased to advertise my mother's race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites.''I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race.''There was something about him that made me wary, a little too sure of himself, maybe. And white.''I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn't speak to my own. It was into my father's image, the black man, son of Africa , that I'd packed all the attributes I sought in myself , the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela.' "Crackers" is as insulting to me as the N-word that we're NOT allowed to say on here, is to them.And for him to refer to his grandmother as a "typical white woman??"  what's that about?  cuz he's a "typical mulatto?" Too many lies!  B.H.O. wrote this book knowing full well that his primary goal in life was to serve as president of the USA. Fortunately today we can read today this book from his earlier years and see precisely why he is not qualified to be president. This book demonstrates in conclusive fashion why he was and is so attracted to the likes of Jeremiah Wright, Louis Farakhan, and his angry wife. He is a brilliant orator, an average writer, and a poor thinker with little originality. So, like most political auto-biographies, save your money and buy it used if you must read it at all. I read this and all recent books claimed to have been written by Obama. I also read that he had help from professional and ghost writers. Obama's books are more narcissism than evidence of a concern for social and economic justice under the US Constitution. Obama is just another great orator with less maturity, experience, and wisdom than most of our national and world thinkers. This book is just one more work of liberal Democrat propaganda. We all have dreams from our fathers...and mothers...but we choose to leave them out of print, so the book is just campaign and election fodder from a youthful and naive left-wing radical...and his even more left-wing and radical revolutionaries. At least Obama can truthfully claim to be African-American, an geographic-ethnic classification claimed in error by most other American blacks. After all, Obama may have been born in Africa and flown to Hawaii, or at least his father was a full African. Just read it - borrowed it from the local library. A lot of great words. Too bad most of the stuff turned out to be lies written with the sole purpose of getting elected. Campaign propaganda I bought this book because I was curious.  Frankly, I'm not voting for Obama and wanted to fact check some comments myself.  This is especially true because the movie 2016 is drawing mostly on comments from this book as well as on the book The Rage of Obama.  I didn't want, however, to contribute to Obama's millions of dollars of rolayties so I bought this book for 1 cent.  I stopped reading it after 10 pages and threw it away.  Actually, I threw it out with in the reclyes bin.I remembered later that there was talked that J. Ayers, the self avowed murderer, was the ghost author of this book.  I'm gldd I threw it away and will just watch the 2016 DVD I recently ordered.Update 6/11/13: Surprise; he's a corrupt dictator. Talk about self-absorbed! Stuck in a self-centered identity crisis that he doesn't seem to grow out of, Obama let me down in this book and I couldn't force myself to read the last section. I ended up selling it at Half-Price Books. This book is a joke. It is silly, self serving and I actually read it and wasted a good 4 hours out of my life that I will NEVER be able to replace. It was horrible. .Obama's books:In a sane world, having the following comments out in print via Obama's racist books would have knocked him out of the running for president of the United States.(they would have crucified a white candidate for far less)From Dreams from My Father," I FOUND A SOLACE IN NURSING A PERVASIVE SENSE OF GRIEVANCE AND ANIMOSITY AGAINST MY MOTHER'S RACE".

Levin ;Obama's America: Unmaking the American Dream by Dinesh D'Souza  ;The Amateur by Edward Klein ;How Obama Betrayed America....And No One Is Holding HIm Accountable by David Horowitz ;Into the Cannibal's Pot by Ilana Mercer;White Girl Bleed A Lot & Don't Make the Black Kids Angry by Colin Flaherty;The Camp of the Saints by Jean Raspail;and all the books written by Jared Taylor; I know ,they look quite irrelevant to this book here per se , but America has reached such a critical conjuncture that we simply cannot allow this kind of feeling-good philosophy rubbish keep purging our thoughts.The country is on her death bed .Please read the books listed above with an open mind, I'm sure you'll get some refreshing(more like astonishing ) truth that the mainstream media simply refuses to tell you.I'll come back and write a full review one day.But for now let's just say he's the most shameless,racist(against white people who are the founding stock and the pillar of this great country),nitwit donkey I've ever seen .He personally(and intentionally)  floods this country with uneducated,unskilled,non-English speaking legal or illegal  immigrants, puts the criminal-prone foreigners' benefits before hardworking honest American taxpayers.And he did all this just to make himself feel like a Savior or a Saint, at the cost of other decent citizens' money, occasionally their life. He's killing America, her descendants and her legacy all together. Too bad I don't believe in hell,for I'm sure if there is one he'll end up burning in it. The ordeal that many reviewers who subserviently brownnose Obama experience is confusing what "Dreams From My Father" accomplishes; Obama's 1995 book DOESN'T in any form come close to qualifying him as presidential material. Shame on the reviewers for abusing a book which tells his mediocre life story from childhood to 33 as the basis for endorsing him!!!! Because of the hype instigated by the liberal media for their favorite mulatto (liberal wet dream of theoretically having the first, sort-of "black" man installed as president), this book's selling aggressively, but in a just world, "Dreams From My Father" should've continued to be relegated to the obscurity it enjoyed before.This book actively makes the case AGAINST Obama ever becoming president as it fails to present him and his unsatisfactory values in any decent light. I'm in the majority of the country--excluding the 35% of blindly worshipping Democrats who hype Obama due to the misconception they owe the black community for slavery by exalting Obama--which is mystified by the insincere sensationalism surrounding Obama. I picked up this book to investigate this empty suit, yet what I discovered was Obama's substanceless character and disappointment at his ideology and "values!!!!"I contemptuously distrust that many of the fanatics giving 5-star reviews to Dreams From My Father have actually read the book (probably all Democrat operatives). The book is a disturbing confession of a racially mixed individual with so much emotional baggage that he's ideological, divisive, self-hating, race-hustling, and mistrustful of the goodness that is America. An example of his ideology is he spends much of the book pushing organizing instead of telling blacks to get a better education to increase their pay; his divisiveness is his association with reverse racism which looks at the destiny of blacks as controlled by whites; his self-hate is he actually compares life of the poor in America with the impoverished masses in Kenya; his race-hustling is his choice to associate almost exclusively with blacks (throughout high school, college, inner-city organizing); and his mistrustfulness in America is his longing to connect with African heritage instead of considering himself American foremost.Much of the book is untrustworthy as Obama presumptuously fakes he's able to remember exact quotes in conversations he's had going back to his childhood!!!! This is simply not plausible, so many personal conversations Obama recounts cannot be believed based on only his memory. Another undesirable sickness his book perpetrates is the unabashed swearing Obama writes down, supposedly recollections from personal conversations, especially blacks in low-class neighborhoods. Nonetheless, this is egregious, repelling the reader.The premise of Dreams From My Father is so unrighteous that it's skewed: it's an homage to his Muslim father, but his father is unmasked as an exorbitantly dislikeable renegade!!!! His dad is culpable for abandoning Obama's white mother and him at an early age; fathering scores of children in Kenya; being a drunk and abusive husband/father when he was ostracized from the Kenyan government's favor; and dying practically penniless without leaving his family anything.His father's ignominious memory begs the question why Obama would write a book expressing such yearning for his father and his African heritage, yet the answer is found in reverse racism. Obama doesn't consider himself mulatto; he militantly views himself 100% black. This is desecration considering the whites in his life--Grampa, Toots, his mother--took care of him!!!!Obama's personal "values" system is quite bankrupt since as a young kid growing up in Hawaii, his coarse Gramps took him to bars in the red light district. Predictably, this damage provoked him to do cocaine and heroin, which he admits on page 87 of his revelatory autobiography.Some of the most anguishing testimony comes during his college "career"--he never mentions getting an undergraduate degree, yet purports that he had a personal secretary while working as a financial writer in his early 20s!--and working to "organize" black communities in Chicago. This favoritism for blacks was from his father's abandonment and Obama's yearning to get close to his father by associating with blacks exclusively. Being the far-left liberal he is, Obama's primary strategies as a community organizer wasn't telling blacks to get a better education to improve their financial situation. It was menacingly getting churches, black groups and unions together to intimidate the local government to dole out money, the quintessential, Democratic strategy for anything!!!!Obama's book has misleadingly connected with liberals/progressive sheeple because it's so sappily melodramatic and pretentious. It agonizingly recounts Obama's sob-story of being racially mixed and feeling empty due to his father's absence; this doesn't make him presidential material, only arrogant to assume he's more special than other mixed-race offspring. Obama's shoddy talent does lie in fiction-writing as his style is very rich in vocabulary, complex sentences and scene-setting. Democrats in their moral relativism find this acceptable enough to exaggerate Obama as presidential material (LOL!!!!). The cover caption by Marian Wright Edelman is deceptive as this book WILL NOT TELL YOU ANYTHING about yourself whether you're black or white!!!! If this doesn't scare you-- nothing will I don`t care what country i`m in, I would never eat dog. That`s gross. Cant believe this guys our president. Our founding fathers needed to create more qualifications to become president. This book really tells what OBAMA is,his mental outlook on life.It will scare the HELL out of you if ,youLOVE THE USA. The State Department loves this book.The U.S. Department of State has bought more than $70,000 worth of books authored by President Obama[...] None This was recommended reading for a class I am currently enrolled in for Race, Gender, Class, and Sexuality. I found the book incredibly difficult to get through due to the writing style. It is written on a low and easily comprehensible level which I feel truly diminished the content. If the goal was to write an easy read it may have been accomplished; but to what advantage I am unsure. I found the grammatical composition (ex. run-on sentences)hard to follow. The read did not engage me on any meaningful level. I did happen to vote for the man. Poorly written.  Disregards the philandering nature of his father.  Ignores many truths in lieu of feeling good about lies.  Skip it.
