 The piano has been drinking,
My necktie is asleep
And the combo went back to New York,
The jukebox has to take a leak
And the carpet needs a haircut,
And the spotlight looks like a prison break
And the telephone's out of cigarettes,
And the balcony is on the make
And the piano has been drinking,
The piano has been drinking And the menus are all freezing,
And the light man's blind in one eye
And he can't see out of the other
And the piano-tuner's got a hearing aid,
And he showed up with his mother
And the piano has been drinking,
The piano has been drinking
As the bouncer is a Sumo wrestler
Cream puff casper milk toast
And the owner is a mental midget
With the I.Q. of a fence post
'Cause the piano has been drinking,
The piano has been drinking And you can't find your waitress
With a Geiger counter
And she hates you and your friends and you
Just can't get served without her
And the box office is drooling,
And the bar stools are on fire
And the newspapers were fooling,
And the ash-trays have retired
'Cause the piano has been drinking,

Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me   Hey Charley I'm pregnant
Living on 9th Street
Right above a dirty bookstore
Off Euclid Avenue
I stopped taking dope
And I quit drinking whiskey
And my old man plays the trombone
And works out at the track He says that he loves me
Even though its not his baby
He says that he'll raise him up
Like he would his own son
He gave me a ring
That was worn by his mother
And he takes me out dancin'
Every Saturday night Hey Charley I think about you
Every time I pass a fillin' station
On account of all the grease
You used to wear in your hair
I still have that record
Of Little Anthony and The Imperials
But someone stole my record player
How do ya like that? Hey Charley I almost went crazy
After Mario got busted
I went back to Omaha
To live with my folks
Everyone I used to know
Was either dead or in prison
So I came back to Minneapolis
This time I think I'm gonna stay Hey Charley I think I'm happy
For the first time since my accident
I wish I had all the money
That we used to spend on dope
I'd buy me a used car lot
And I wouldn't sell any of 'em
I'd just drive a different car every day
Dependin' on how I feel Hey Charley, for chrissakes
Do you want to know the truth of it?
I don't have a husband
He don't play the trombone
I need to borrow money
To pay this lawyer
And Charley, hey
I'll be eligible for parole
Come Valentine's Day The bats are in the belfry
The dew is on the moor
Where are the arms that held me?
And pledged her love before?
And pledged her love before? It's such a sad old feeling
The hills are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
When you dream, you're innocent when you dream I made a golden promise
That we would never part
I gave my love a locket
And then I broke her heart
And then I broke her heart It's such a sad old feeling
The fields are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
Innocent when you dream Running through the graveyard
We laughed my, friends and I
We swore we'd be together
Until the day we died
Until the day we died It's such a sad old feeling
The fields are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
When you dream Eddie Graces Buick got four bullet holes in the side
And Charlie Delisle sittin' at the top of an avocado tree
Mrs. Stormll stab you with a steak knife if you step on her lawn
I got a half pack of Lucky Strikes, man, so come along with me
Lets fill our pockets with macadamia nuts, then go over to Bobby Goodmansons
And jump off the roof Hilda plays strip poker and her mamas across the street
Joey Navinski says she put her tongue in his mouth
Dicky Faulkners got a switchblade and some gooseneck risers that eucalyptus is a hunchback
There's a wind up from the south
So let me tie you up with kite string and I'll show you the scabs on my knee
Watch out for the broken glass, put your shoes and socks on and come along with me
Lets follow that fire truck
I think your house is burnin' down
Then go down to the hobo jungle
And kill some rattlesnakes with a trowel
We'll break all the windows in the old Anderson place
And steal a bunch of boysenberrys
And smear 'em on our face
I'll get a dollar from my mamas purse
And buy that skull and crossbones ring
And you can wear it around your neck
On an old piece of string Then we'll spit on Ronnie Arnold
And flip him the bird
And slash the tires on the school bus
Now don't say a word
I'll take a rusty nail
And scratch your initials on my arm
And I'll show you how to sneak up on the roof of the drugstore I'll take the spokes from your wheelchair
And a magpies wings
And I'll tie 'em to your shoulders and your feet
I'll steal a hacksaw from my dad
And cut the braces off your legs
And we'll bury them tonight in the cornfield Put a church key in your pocket
We'll hop that freight train in the hall
And we'll slide all the way down the drain
To New Orleans in the fall Well, the smart money's on Harlow and the moon is in the street
And the shadow boys are breaking all the laws
And you're east of East Saint Louis and the wind is making speeches
And the rain sounds like a round of applause
And Napoleon is weeping in a carnival saloon
His invisible fiancee's in the mirror
And the band is going home, it's raining hammers, it's raining nails
And it's true there's nothing left for him down here And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time, that you love
And it's time, time, time And they all pretend they're orphans and their memory's like a train
You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away
And the things you can't remember tell the things you can't forget
That history puts a saint in every dream Well, she said she'd stick around until the bandages came off
But these mama's boys just don't know when to quit
And Mathilda asks the sailors "are those dreams or are those prayers?"
So close your eyes, son, and this won't hurt a bit Oh, it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time that you love
And it's time, time, time Well, things are pretty lousy for a calendar girl
The boys just dive right off the cars and splash into the street
And when they're on a roll she pulls a razor from her boot
And a thousand pigeons fall around her feet
So put a candle in the window and a kiss upon his lips
As the dish outside the window fills with rain
Just like a stranger with the weeds in your heart
And pay the fiddler off 'til I come back again Oh, it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time that you love
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time that you love

Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me The phone's off the hook, no one knows where we are
It's a long time since I drank champagne
The ocean's blue, as blue as your eyes
I'm gonna take it with me when I go Old long since gone, now way back when
We lived in Coney Island
There ain't no good thing ever dies
I'm gonna take it with me when I go Far, far away a train whistle blows
Wherever you're goin', wherever you've been
Waving goodbye at the end of the day
You're up and you're over, and you're far away Always for you, and forever yours
It felt just like the old days
We fell asleep on Beaula's porch
I'm gonna take it with me when I go All broken down by the side of the road
I's never more alive or alone
I've worn the faces off all the cards
I'm gonna take it with me when I go The children are playing at the end of the day
Strangers are singing on our lawn
It's got to be more than flesh and bone
All that you've loved is all you own In a land there's a town, and in that town there's a house
And in that house there's a woman
And in that woman there's a heart I love
I'm gonna take it with me when I go I'm gonna take it with me when I go Edna Million in a drop-dead suit
Dutch Pink on a downtown train
Two-dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot
I'm in the corner in the pouring rain
Sixteen men on a dead man's chest
And I've been drinking from a broken cup
Two pairs of pants and a mohair vest
I'm full of bourbon, I can't stand up Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are alone
Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are alone Schiffer broke a bottle on Morgan's head
And I've been stepping on the Devil's tail
Across the stripes of a full moon's head
And through the bars of a Cuban jail
Bloody fingers on a purple knife
Flamingo drinking from a cocktail glass
I'm on the lawn with someone else's wife
Admire the view from up on top of the mast Hey little bird, fly away home
House is on fire, your children are alone
Hey little bird, fly away home
House is on fire, your children are alone I said hey little bird, fly away home
House is on fire, your children are alone
Hey little bird, fly away home
House is on fire, your children are alone Yellow sheets on a Hong Kong bed
Stazybo horn and a Slingerland ride
"To the carnival" is what she said
A hundred dollars makes it dark inside Edna Million in a drop-dead suit
Dutch Pink on a downtown train
Two-dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot
I'm in the corner in the pouring rain Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are alone
Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are alone When you walk through the garden
You gotta watch your back
Well, I beg your pardon
Walk the straight and narrow track
If you walk with Jesus
He's gonna save your soul
You gotta keep the devil
Way down in the hole He's got the fire and the fury
At his command
Well, you don't have to worry
If you hold on to Jesus' hand
We'll all be safe from Satan
When the thunder rolls
We just gotta help me keep the devil
Way down in the hole All the angels sing
About Jesus' mighty sword
And they'll shield you with their wings
And keep you close to the lord
Don't pay heed to temptation
For his hands are so cold
You gotta help me keep the devil
Way down in the hole Down in the hole, down in the hole
Down in the hole, down in the hole
Down in the hole, down in the hole
You gotta help me keep the devil
Down in the hole In between love and trying to scheme love
Who can tell what we may find
Never thought love, not get caught love
Between the magic in your eyes
And loves like women, it's cool and breezy
Never thought that love could be so easy In between love and trying to scheme love
And in between love again In between love and trying to scheme love
Who can tell what we may find
All this time love, I sublime love
To the feelings in my mind
Loves like women, it's cool and breezy
Never thought that love could be so easy In between love and trying to scheme love
And in between love again Sane, sane, they're all insane
Fireman's blind, the conductor is lame
A Cincinnati jacket and a sad-luck dame
Hanging out the window with a bottle full of rain
Clap hands, clap hands
Clap hands, clap hands Said roar, roar, the thunder and the roar
Son of a bitch is never coming back here no more
The moon in the window and a bird on the pole
We can always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal
Clap hands, clap hands
Clap hands, clap hands Said steam, steam, a hundred bad dreams
Going up to Harlem with a pistol in his jeans
A fifty-dollar bill inside a palladin's hat
And nobody's sure where Mr. Knickerbocker's at Roar, roar, the thunder and the roar
Son of a bitch is never coming back here no more
Moon in the window and a bird on the pole
Always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal
Clap hands, clap hands
Clap hands, clap hands I said steam, steam, a hundred bad dreams
Going up to Harlem with a pistol in his jeans
A fifty-dollar bill inside a palladin's hat
And nobody's sure where Mr. Knickerbocker's at Shine, shine, a Roosevelt dime
All the way to Baltimore and running out of time
Salvation Army seemed to wind up in the hole
They all went to heaven in a little row boat
Clap hands, clap hands
Clap hands, clap hands
Clap hands, clap hands
Clap hands, clap hands
Well, clap hands, well, clap hands
Oh, clap hands, clap hands Tight-slacked clad girls on the graveyard shift
Neath the cement stroll
Catch the midnight drift
Cigar chewing Charlie
In the newspaperness
Grifting hot-horse tips
On who's running the best [Chorus]
And I'm blinded by the neon
Don't try and change my tune
Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon And the moon's a silver slipper
It's pouring champagne stars
Broadway's like a serpent
Pulling shiny top-down cars
Laramer is teeming
With that undulating beat
And some Bonneville is screaming
It's way wilder down the street [Chorus] Hearts flutter and race
The moon's on the wane
Tarts mutter their dream hopes
The night will ordain
Come schemers and dancers
Cherry delight
As a Cleveland-bound Greyhound
And it cuts through the night And I've hawked all my yesterdays
Don't try and change my tune
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon Well, the eggs chase the bacon round the fryin' pan
And the whinin' dog pigeons by the steeple bell rope
And the dogs tipped the garbage pails over last night
And there's always construction work bothering you
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood Well, Friday's a funeral and Saturday's a bride
Sey's got a pistol on the register side
And the goddamn delivery trucks, they make too much noise
And we don't get our butter delivered no more
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood Well, Big Mambo's kicking his old greyhound
And the kids can't get ice cream 'cause the market burned down
And the newspaper sleeping bags blow down the lane
And that goddamn flatbed's got me pinned in again
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood There's a couple Filipino girls gigglin' by the church
And the window is busted and the landlord ain't home
And Butch joined the army, yeah, that's where he's been
And the jackhammer's diggin' up the sidewalks again
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood Liar liar with your pants on fire, white spades hangin' on the telephone
Wire, gamblers reevaluate along the dotted line, you'll never recognize
Yourself on heartattack and vine. Doctor lawyer beggar man thief, Philly Joe remarkable looks on in disbelief,
If you want a taste of madness, you'll have to wait in line, you'll probably
See someone you know on heartattack and vine. Boney's high on china white, shorty found a punk, don't you know there ain't
No devil, there's just god when he's drunk, well this stuff will probably kill
You, let's do another line, what you say you meet me down on heartattack and
Vine. See that little jersey girl in the see-through top, with the peddle pushers
Sucking on a soda pop, well I bet she's still a virgin but it's only twenty-
Five 'til nine, you can see a million of 'em on heartattack and vine. Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did
I got what I paid for now
See ya tomorrow, hey Frank can I borrow
A couple of bucks from you
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
No one speaks English, and everything's broken
And my Stacys are soaking wet
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me Now the dogs are barking
And the taxicabs parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me
You tore my shirt open
And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old Bushmills I staggered
You buried the dagger in
Your silhouette window light
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me Now I've lost my St. Christopher
Now that I've kissed her and the
And the one-armed bandit knows
And the maverick Chinaman, and the cold-blooded signs
And the girls down by the strip tease shows go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me No, I don't want your sympathy
The fugitives say that the streets aren't for dreaming now
Manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories
They want a piece of the action anyhow
Go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me And you can ask any sailor
And the keys from the jailer
And the old men in wheelchairs know
That Matilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me And it's a battered old suitcase
To a hotel someplace
And a wound that will never heal
No prima donna, the perfume is on
An old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street sweepers
The night watchman flame keepers
And goodnight Matilda, too [instrumental] Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue,
Well the music plays and you display
Your heart for me to see,
I had a beer and now I hear you
Calling out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you. Well the room is crowded, people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well if you sit down with this old clown,
Take that frown and break it,
Before the evening's gone away,
I think that we could make it,
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you. Well the night does funny things inside a man
These old tom-cat feelings you don't understand,
Well I turn around to look at you,
You light a cigarette,
I wish I had the guts to bum one,
But we've never met,
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you. I can see that you are lonesome just like me,
And it being late, you'd like some some company,
Well I turn around to look at you,
And you look back at me,
The guy you're with has up and split,
The chair next to you's free,
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me. Put a dead cat on the railroad tracks
When the wolf bains
Bloomin' by the tressel
And get the eyeball of a rooster
And the stones from a ditch
And wash 'em down with bilge water
And you say, "You'll never snitch" Take the buttons from a yellow jacket
The feather from a buzzard
The blood from a bounty hunters cold black heart
Catch the tears of a widow
In a thimble made of glass
Tell your mama and your papa
They can kick your ass Poison all the water in the wishin' well
And hang all them scarecrows
From a sycamore tree
Burn down all those honeymoons
Put 'em in a pillow case
And wait next to the switch blades
At the amusement park for me Strangle all the Christmas carols
Scratch out all your prayers
Tie 'em up with barbed wire
And push them down the stairs
And I'll whittle you a pistol
For keepin' nightmares of your blinds
Them son of a bitches always
Seem to sneak up from behind Syphon all the gas
From your daddy's pickup truck
Fill up Johnny's T-bird
I got a couple of bucks
Put a little perfume
And ribbon in your hair
Careful that you don't wake up the hounds Tear a bolt of lightnin'
Of the side of the sky
And throw it in the cedar chest
If you want to tell me why
Bring the gear shift knob from a 49 Merc
And lay down here beside me
Let me hold you in the dirt You're gonna tremble
Tear the throat out of the night
Sink your teeth into my shoulder
Dig your nails into my back
Tell that little girl to let go of my sleeve
You'll be a woman when I catch you
Come baby, fall in love with me With my double barrel shotgun
And a whole box of shells
We'll celebrate the fourth of July
We'll do 100 M.P.H.
Spendin', someone else's dough
And we'll drive all the way to Reno
On the wrong side of the road On the wrong side of the road
On the wrong side of the road
Wrong side of the road
Wrong side of the road
Wrong side of the road Nighthawks at the diner
Of Emma's 49er, there's a rendezvous
Of strangers around the coffee urn tonight
All the gypsy hacks, the insomniacs
Now the paper's been read
Now the waitress said
Eggs and sausage and a side of toast
Coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy
Chile in a bowl with burgers and fries
What kind of pie?
In a graveyard charade, a late shift masquerade
Two for a quarter, dime for a dance
With Woolworth rhinestone diamond
Earrings, and a sideway's glance
And now the register rings
And now the waitress sings
(chorus) the classified section offered no direction
It's a cold caffeine in a nicotine cloud
Now the touch of your fingers
Lingers burning in my memory
I've been 86ed from your scheme
I'm in a melodramatic nocturnal scene
I'm a refugee from a disconcerted affair
As the lead pipe morning falls
And the waitress calls
(chorus) Will you take me across the Channel
London Bridge is falling down
Strange a woman tries to save
What a man will try to drown
And it's the rain that they predicted
Its the forecast every time
The rose has died because you picked it
I believe that brandy's mine [Chorus]
And all over the world strangers
Talk only about the weather
All over the world
It's the same, it's the same And the world is getting flatter
And the sky is falling all around
Oh and nothing is the matter
For I never cry in town
And a love like ours, my dear
Is best measured when its down
And I never buy umbrellas
Cause there's always one around [Chorus] And you know that its beginning
And you know that its the end
Once again we are strangers
As the fog comes rolling in And all over the world strangers
Talk only about the weather
All over the world
It's the same, it's the same
It's the same Operator, number, please
It's been so many years
Will she remember my old voice
While I fight the tears?
Hello, hello there, is this Martha?
This is old Tom Frost
And I am calling long distance
Don't worry 'bout the cost
'Cause it's been forty years or more
Now Martha please recall
Meet me out for coffee
Where we'll talk about it all And those were the days of roses
Poetry and prose and Martha
All I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows
We'd packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day And I feel so much older now
And you're much older too
How's your husband?
And how's your kids?
You know that I got married too?
Lucky that you found someone
To make you feel secure
'Cause we were all so young and foolish
Now we are mature And those were the days of roses
Poetry and prose and Martha
All I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows
We'd packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day And I was always so impulsive
I guess that I still am
And all that really mattered then
Was that I was a man
I guess that our being together
Was never meant to be
And Martha, Martha
I love you can't you see? And those were the days of roses
Poetry and prose and Martha
All I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows
We'd packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day And I remember quiet evenings
Trembling close to you Well you gassed her up
Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night And you got paid on Friday
And your pockets are jinglin'
And you see the lights
You get all tinglin' cause you're cruisin' with a six
And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night Then you comb your hair
Shave your face
Tryin' to wipe out ev'ry trace
All the other days
In the week you know that this'll be the Saturday
You're reachin' your peak Stoppin' on the red
You're goin' on the green
'Cause tonight'll be like nothin'
You've ever seen
And you're barrelin' down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night Tell me is the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzin'?
Telephone's ringin', it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye?
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
'Cause you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
And now you're stumblin'
You're stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night Well you gassed her up
And you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrellin' down the boulevard,
You're lookin' for the heart of Saturday night Is this the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzin'?
Telephone's ringin', it's your second cousin
And the barmaid is smilin' from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye Makes it kind of special down in the core
And you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumblin'
Stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
And you're stumblin'
Stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
Mhm, mhm Crestfallen sidekick in an old cafe
Never slept with a dream before he had to go away
There's a bell in the tower, Uncle Ray bought a round
Don't worry 'bout the army in the cold, cold ground Cold, cold ground
Cold, cold ground
Cold, cold ground Now don't be a cry baby when there's wood in the shed
There's a bird in the chimney and a stone in my bed
When the road's washed out, we pass the bottle around
And wait in the arms of the cold, cold ground The cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground There's a ribbon in the willow and a tire swing rope
Oh, and a briar patch of berries takin' over the slope
The cat'll sleep in the mailbox and we'll never go to town
Till we bury every dream in the cold, cold ground In the cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground Give me a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells
Blow the roof off the goat barn, let it roll down the hill
The piano is firewood, Times Square is a dream
I find we'll lay down together in the cold, cold ground The cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground We'll call the cops on the Breedloves, bring a Bible and a rope
And a whole box of Rebel and a bar of soap
Make a pile of truck tires and burn 'em all down
Bring a dollar with you, baby, in the cold, cold ground In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground Take a weathervane rooster, throw rocks at his head
Stop talking to the neighbors until we all go dead
Beware of my temper and the dog that I've found
Break all the windows in the cold, cold ground In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground Got no time for the corner boys,
Down in the street makin' all that noise,
Don't want no whores on eighth avenue,
Cause tonight I'm gonna be with you. 'Cause tonight I'm gonna take that ride,
Across the river to the jersey side,
Take my baby to the carnival,
And I'll take you on all the rides,
Sing sha la la la la la sha la la la. Down the shore everything's alright,
You're with your baby on a Saturday night,
Don't you know that all my dreams come true,
When I'm walkin' down the street with you,
Sing sha la la la la la sha la la la. You know she thrills me with all her charms,
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms,
My little angel gives me everything,
I know someday that she'll wear my ring. So don't bother me cause I got no time,
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine,
Nothin' else matters in this whole wide world,
When you're in love with a jersey girl,
Sing sha la la la la la la. And I call your name, I can't sleep at night,
Sha la la la la la la. Well, he came home from the war
With a party in his head
And modified Brougham DeVille
And a pair of legs that opened up like butterfly wings
And a mad dog that wouldn't sit still
He went and took up with a Salvation Army band girl
Who played dirty water on a swordfishtrombone
He went to sleep at the bottom of Tenkiller lake
And he said "gee, but it's great to be home"
Well, he came home from the war with a party in his head
And an idea for a fireworks display
And he knew that he'd be ready with a stainless steel machete
And a half a pint of Ballentine's each day
And he holed up in room above a hardware store
Cryin' nothing there but Hollywood tears
He put a spell on some poor little Crutchfield girl
And stayed like that for twenty-seven years
He packed up all his expectations, he lit out for California
With a flyswatter banjo on his knee
With a lucky tiger in his angel hair and Benzedrine for getting there
They found him in a eucalyptus tree
Lieutenant got him a canary bird and skanked her head with every word
Chesterfielded moonbeams in a song
He got twenty years for lovin' her from some Oklahoma governor
Said "everything this Doughboy does is wrong"
Now some say he's doing the obituary mambo
Now some say that he's hanging on the wall
Perhaps this yarn's the only thing that holds this man together
Some say he was never here at all
And some say they saw him down in Birmingham
Sleeping in a boxcar going by
And if you think that you can tell a bigger tale
I swear to God you'd have to tell a lie Rattle big black bones in the danger zone
There's a rumblin' groan down below
There's a big dark town, it's a place I've found
There's a world going on underground They're alive, they're awake
While the rest of the world is asleep
Below the mineshaft roads it will all unfold
There's a world going on underground All the roots hang down
Swing from town to town
They are marching around down under your boots
All the trucks unload
Beyond the gopher holes
There's a world going on underground We sail tonight for Singapore
We're all as mad as hatters here
I've fallen for a tawny moor
Took off to the land of nod
Drank with all the Chinamen
Walked the sewers of Paris
I danced along a colored wind
Dangled from a rope of sand
You must say goodbye to me We sail tonight for Singapore
Don't fall asleep while you're ashore
Cross your heart and hope to die
When you hear the children cry
Let marrow bone and cleaver choose
While making feet for children's shoes
Through the alley, back from hell
When you hear that steeple bell
You must say goodbye to me Wipe him down with gasoline
Till his arms are hard and mean
From now on boys this iron boat's your home
So heave away, boys We sail tonight for Singapore
Take your blankets from the floor
Wash your mouth out by the door
The whole town's made of iron ore
Every witness turns to steam
They all become Italian dreams
Fill your pockets up with earth
Get yourself a dollar's worth
Away boys, away boys, heave away The captain is a one-armed dwarf
He's throwing dice along the wharf
In the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king
So take this ring We sail tonight for Singapore
We're all as mad as hatters here
I've fallen for a tawny moor
Took off to the land of nod
Drank with all the Chinamen
Walked the sewers of Paris
I drank along a colored wind
I dangled from a rope of sand
You must say goodbye to me Blue skies over my head
Give me another reason to get out of bed
And blue skies shine on my face
Give me another woman to take her place Ain't got no money, cupboards are bare
No cigarettes and the kids got nothing to wear
She walked out without a word
Now the only sound left is the morning bird
singing ... Blue skies over my head
Give me another reason to get out of bed
And blue skies shine on my face
Give me another woman to take her place Blue skies over my head
Give me another reason to get out of bed
And blue skies shine on my face
Give me another woman to take her place
Give me another woman to take her place There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
Somewhere
There's a time for us
Someday there'll be a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn
Time to care
Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find there's a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Hold my hand
And I'll take you there
Somehow
Someday, somewhere They hung a sign up in our town
"If you live it up, you won't live it down"
So she left Monte Rio, son
Just like a bullet leaves a gun
With her charcoal eyes and Monroe hips
She went and took that California trip
Oh, the moon was gold, her hair like wind
Said, "don't look back, just come on, Jim" Oh, you got to hold on, hold on
You gotta hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here, you gotta hold on Well, he gave her a dimestore watch
And a ring made from a spoon
Everyone's looking for someone to blame
When you share my bed, you share my name
Well, go ahead and call the cops
You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops
She said, "baby, I still love you"
Sometimes there's nothin' left to do Oh, but you got to hold on, hold on
Babe, you gotta hold on and take my hand
I'm standing right here, you gotta hold on Well, God bless your crooked little heart
St. Louis got the best of me
I miss your broken China voice
How I wish you were still here with me
Oh, you build it up, you wreck it down
Then you burn your mansion to the ground
Oh, there's nothing left to keep you here
But when you're falling behind in this big blue world Oh, you've got to hold on, hold on
Babe, you gotta hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here, you gotta hold on Down by the Riverside motel
It's ten below and falling
By a ninety-nine cent store
She closed her eyes and started swaying
But it's so hard to dance that way
When it's cold and there's no music
Oh, your old hometown's so far away
But inside your head there's a record that's playing A song called "Hold On", hold on
Babe, you gotta hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right there, you gotta hold on You gotta hold on, hold on
Babe, you gotta hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right there, you gotta hold on You gotta hold on, hold on
Babe, you gotta hold on
And take my hand, I'm standing right here, you gotta hold on You gotta hold on, hold on
Babe, you gotta hold on
And take my hand, I'm standing right here, you gotta hold on You gotta hold on
You gotta hold on
You gotta hold on
You gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, baby
You gotta hold on, girl
You gotta hold on
You gotta hold on Friday left me fumblin' with the blues
And it's hard to win when you always lose
Because the nightspots spend your spirit
Beat your head against the wall
Two dead ends and you've still got to choose You know the bartenders
They all know my name
And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame
And I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyster shaking my head
When I should be living clean instead You know the ladies I've been seeing off and on
Well they spend your love and then they're gone
You can't be lovin' someone who is savage and cruel
Take your love and then they leave on out of town
No they do Well now fallin' in love is such a breeze
But its standin' up that's so hard for me
I want to squeeze you but I'm scared to death I'd break your back
You know your perfume
Well it won't let me be You know the bartenders all know my name
And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame
And I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyster shaking my head
When I should be living clean instead Come on baby
Let your love light shine
Gotta bury me inside of your fire
Because your eyes are 'nough to blind me
You're like a-looking at the sun
You gotta whisper tell me I'm the one
Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one
Gotta whisper tell me I'm the one
Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one [Chorus:]
Well I got here at eight and I'll be here till two
I'll try my best to entertain you and
Please don't mind me if I get a bit crude
I'm your late night evening prostitute So drink your martinis and stare at the moon
Don't mind me I'll continue to croon
Don't mind me if I get a bit loon
I'm your late night evening prostitute And dance, have a good time
I'll continue to shine
Yes Dance, have a good time
Don't mind me if I slip upon a rhyme [Chorus]
Well I got here at eight and I'll be here till two
I'll try my best to entertain you and
Please don't mind me if I get a bit crude
I'm your late night evening prostitute [Repeat: x2] All night long on the broken glass
Living in a medicine chest
Medite-Romanian hotel back
Sprawled across a roll top desk
The monkey rode a blade on an overhead fan
They paint the donkey blue if you pay
I got a telephone call from Istanbul
My baby's coming home today Will you sell me one of those if I shave my head?
"Get me out of town" is what fireball said
Never trust a man in a blue trenchcoat
Never drive a car when you're dead
Saturday's a festival, Friday's a gem
Dye your hair yellow and raise your hand
Follow me to Beulah's on dry creek road
I got to wear the hat that my baby done sewed Will you sell me one of those if I shave my head?
"Get me out of town" is what fireball said
Never trust a man in a blue trenchcoat
Never drive a car when you're dead
Saturday's a festival, Friday's a gem
Dye your hair yellow and raise your hand
Follow me to Beulah's on dry creek road
I got to wear the hat that my baby done sewed Well, take me down to buy a tux on red rose bear
I got to cut a hole in the day
I got a telephone call from Istanbul
My baby's coming home today My head is spinning round
My heart is in my shoes, yeah
I went and set the Thames on fire, oh
Now I must come back down
She's laughing in her sleeve, boys
I can feel it in my bones
Oh, but anywhere, anywhere I'm gonna lay my head
Oh, I'm gonna call my home Well, I see that the world is upside-down
Seems that my pockets were filled up with gold
And now the clouds, Well they've covered everything over
And the wind is blowing cold
Well, I don't need anybody
Because I learned, I learned to be alone
Well, I said anywhere, anywhere, anywhere I lay my head, boys
Well, I'm gonna call my home Well you see I happened to be back on the east coast
A few years back tryin' to make me a buck
Like everybody else, well you know
Times get hard and well I got down on my luck
And I got tired of just roamin' and bummin'
Around, so I started thumbin' my way
Back to my old hometown
You know I made quite a few miles
In the first couple of days, and I
Figured I'd be home in a week if my
Luck held out this way
But you know it was the third night
I got stranded, it was out at a cold lonely
Crossroads, and as the rain came
Pouring down, I was hungry, tired
Freezin', caught myself a chill, but
It was just about that time that
The lights of an old semi topped the hill
You should of seen me smile when I
Heard them air brakes come on, and
I climbed up in that cab where I
Knew it'd be warm at the wheel
Well at the wheel sat a big man
I'd have to say he must of weighed 210
The way he stuck out a big hand and
Said with a grin "Big Joe's the name
And this here rig's called Phantom 309"
Well I asked him why he called his
Rig such a name, but he just turned to me
And said "Why son don't you know this here
Rig'll be puttin' 'em all to shame, why
There ain't a driver on this
Or any other line for that matter
That's seen nothin' but the taillights of Big Joe
And Phantom 309"
So we rode and talked the better part of the night
And I told my stories and Joe told his and
I smoked up all his Viceroys as we rolled along
He pushed her ahead with 10 forward gears
Man that dashboard was lit like the old
Madam La Rue pinball, a serious semi truck
Until almost mysteriously, well it was the
Lights of a truck stop that rolled into sight
Joe turned to me and said "I'm sorry son
But I'm afraid this is just as far as you go
You see I kinda gotta be makin' a turn
Just up the road a piece," but I'll be
Damned if he didn't throw me a dime as he
Threw her in low and said "Go on in there
Son, and get yourself a hot cup of coffee
On Big Joe"
And when Joe and his rig pulled off into
The night, man in nothing flat they was
Clean outta sight
So I walked into the old stop and
Ordered me up a cup of mud sayin'
"Big Joe's settin' this dude up" but
It got so deathly quiet in that
Place, you could of heard a pin drop
As the waiter's face turned kinda
Pale, I said "What's the matter did
I say somethin' wrong?" I kinda
Said with 8a half way grin. He said
"No son, you see It'll happen every
Now and then. You see every driver in
Here knows Big Joe, but let me
Tell you what happened just ten years
Ago, yea it was ten years ago
Out there at that cold lonely crossroads
Where you flagged Joe down, and
There was a whole bus load of kids
And they were just comin' from school
And they were right in the middle when
Joe topped the hill, and could
Have been slaughtered except
Joe turned his wheels, and
He jackknifed, and went
Into a skid, and folks around here
Say he gave his life to save that bunch
Of kids, and out there at that cold
Lonely crossroads, well they say it
Was the end of the line for
Big Joe and Phantom 309, but it's
Funny you know, cause every now and then
Yea every now and then, when the
Moon's holdin' water, they say old Joe
Will stop and give you a ride, and
Just like you, some hitchhiker will be
Comin' by"
"So here son," he said to me, "get
Yourself another cup of coffee, it's on the
House, you see I want you to hang on
To that dime, yea you hang on to that
Dime as a kind of souvenir, a
Souvenir of Big Joe and Phantom 309" The sun come up, it was blue and gold
The sun come up, it was blue and gold
The sun come up, it was blue and gold
Ever since I put your picture in a frame I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
Ever since I put your picture in a frame I'm gonna love you
Till the wheels come off
Oh, yeah I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
Ever since I put your picture in a frame I'll shoot the moon
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll be the pennies
On your eyes
For you baby I want to take you
Out to the fair
Here's a red rose
Ribbon for your hair I'll shoot the moon
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon
For you A vulture circles
Over your head
For you baby
I'll be the flowers
After you're dead
For you baby I want to build
A nest in your hair
I want to kiss you
And never be there I'll shoot the moon
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon
For you The evening fell just like a star
Left a trail behind
You spit as you slammed out the door
If this is love we're crazy
As we fight like cats and dogs
But I just know there's got to be more So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain I admit that I ain't no angel
I admit that I ain't no saint
I'm selfish and I'm cruel and I'm blind
If I exorcise my devils
Well my angels may leave too
When they leave they're so hard to find So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain We're always at each other's throats
It drives me up the wall
Most of the time I'm just blowing off steam
And I wish to God you'd leave me
And I wish to God you'd stay
Life's so different than it is in your dreams So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain Broken bicycles, old busted chains
With busted handle bars out in the rain.
Somebody must have an orphanage for
All these things that nobody wants any more
September's reminding July
It's time to be saying good-bye
Summer is gone, Our love will remain
Like old broken bicycles out in the rain Broken bicycles, don't tell my folks
There's all those playing cards pinned to the spokes
Laid down like skeletons out on the lawn
The wheels won't turn when the other has gone
The seasons can turn on a dime
Somehow I forget every time
For all the things that you've given me
Will always stay, there broken but I'll never throw them away Little black girl in a red dress,
On a hot night with a broken shoe.
Little black girl you shouldn't never left home,
There's probably someone that's still waiting up for you.
It's cold back in Chicago,
But Los Angeles' street's worse,
When all you got is $29.00 and an alligator purse! You'll see that vulture in the Fleetwood,
With the chartreuse hood!
It's time to get your bearings and say hey baby:
Which way's to the Main Stem?
And where ever you say you're from,
Say you grew up there yourself
Say, come on, you grew up right next door to him:
Take the left on Central
And throw it in reverse:
Cause you only got $29.00 and an alligator purse! And he'll come on just like a gentleman
And you'll be a little shy!
You say your ex old man was a sax player
He'll say baby I used to play bass with Sly!
And you say you like his Cadillac,
Say honey I got two or three!
He'll say: Sweetheart you're sure fortunate
That you ran into me!
When you've done a dime in the joint!
You figure nothin' could be worse:
And you got $29.00 in an alligator purse! Well: He got Pharaoh on the eight track
You start smokin' a little boo!
You thinking gettin' out of Chicago was the
Best thing ever happened to you!
He's starting like a dog rhythm
And the cats seem to be cool!
He says: Baby, I know a good ol' jailhouse
In West Hollywood that's just right for you!
But he ain't no good Samaritan,
He'll make sure you're reimbursed!!
A lot more than $29.00 and an alligator purse! Now when the streets get hungry, baby,
You can almost hear them growl!
Someone's setting a place for you,
When the dogs begin to howl! Well: The streets are dead they creep. It was left on the pole!
They make that the suckers always make mistakes
When they're far away from home!
Chicken in a pot
Whoever gets their first
Gonna get himself $29.00 and an alligator purse! Now, for the sirens it's just an epilogue
The cops always get there too late!
They always stop for coffee
On the way to the scene of the crime!
They always try so hard to look like movie stars,
They couldn't catch a cold!
Baby: don't waste your dime
You're lucky to be alive!
The doctor whispered to the nurse:
She only lost a half pint of blood!
$29.00 and an alligator purse! Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon, independent as a hog on ice
He's a big-shot down there at the slaughterhouse
Plays accordion for Mr. Weiss Uncle Biltmore and Uncle William
Made a million during World War Two
But they're tightwads and they're cheapskates
And they'll never give a dime to you Auntie Mame has gone insane
She lives in the doorway of an old hotel
And the radio is playing opera
All she ever says is go to hell Uncle Violet flew as a pilot
And there ain't no pretty girls in France
Now he runs a tiny little bookie joint
They say he never keeps it in his pants Uncle Bill will never leave a will
And the tumor is as big as an egg
He has a mistress, she's Puerto Rican
And I heard she has a wooden leg Uncle Phil can't live without his pills
He has emphysema and he's almost blind
And we must find out where the money is
Get it now before he loses his mind Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon, independent as a hog on ice
He's a big shot down there at the slaughterhouse
He plays accordion for Mr. Weiss You gentlemen who think you have a mission
To purge us of the seven deadly sins
Should first sort out the basic food position
Then start your preaching, that's where it begins You lot who preach restraint and watch your waist as well
Should learn, for once, the way the world is run
However much you twist or whatever lies that you tell
Food is the first thing, morals follow on So first make sure that those who are now starving
Get proper helpings when we all start carving
What keeps mankind alive? What keeps mankind alive?
The fact that millions are daily tortured
Stifled, punished, silenced and oppressed
Mankind can keep alive thanks to its brilliance
In keeping its humanity repressed
And for once you must try not to shriek the facts
Mankind is kept alive by bestial acts Grapefruit moon, one star shining, shining down on me
Heard that tune, and now I'm pining, honey, can't you see?
'Cause every time I hear that melody, well, something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, can't turn back the tide Never had no destinations, could not get across
You became my inspiration, oh but what a cost
'Cause every time I hear that melody, well, something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is more than I can hide Now I'm smoking cigarettes and I strive for purity
And I slip just like the stars into obscurity
'Cause every time I hear that melody, well, puts me up a tree
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is all that I can see Romeo is bleeding, not so as you'd notice
He's over on 18th street as usual
Lookin' so hard against the hood of his car
Puttin' out a cigarette in his hand
For all the pachucos at the pumps
At Romero's Paint and Body They're all seein' how far they can spit
Well, it was just another night
And now they're huddled in the
Brake lights of a 58 Belair
And listenin' to how Romeo killed
The Sheriff with his knife And they all jump when they hear the sirens
Romeo just laughs
"All the racket in the world ain't never gonna
Save that Coppers' ass
He ain't never gonna see another summertime
For gunnin' down my brother
Leavin' him like a dog
Beneath a car without his knife" Romeo says," Hey man, gimme a cigarette"
And they all reach for their pack
Frankie lights it for him and pats him on the back
An' throws a bottle at a milk truck
And as it breaks, he grabs his nuts
An' they all know, they could be just like Romeo
If they only had the guts Romeo is bleeding, nobody can tell
An' he sings along with the radio
With a bullet in his chest
An' he combs back his fenders
They all agree it's clear
That everything is cool, and if Romeo was here Romeo is bleeding an' he winces now an' then
An' he leans against the car door
Feels the blood in his shoes
Someone's cryin' at the fire point
In the phone booth by the store Romeo starts his engines
Wipes the blood off the door
And he brodys through the signal
With the radio full blast
Leavin' the boys there, hikin' up their chinos
And now they're all tryin' to stand like Romeo
With the moon, cut like a sickle
And they're talkin' now in Spanish, all about their hero Romeo is bleeding as he gives the man his ticket
And he climbs the balcony at the movies
And he'll die without a whimper
Like every hero's dream
Like an angel with a bullet
And Cagney on a screen Romeo is bleeding
Romeo is bleeding
Hey man, Romeo is bleeding
Hey man, Romeo is bleeding
Hey man, Romeo is bleeding [Foreign content] Rudy's on the midway
And Jacob's in the hole
The monkey's on the ladder
The devil shovels coal
With crows as big as airplanes
The lion has three heads
And someone will eat the skin the he sheds
And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
Dreaming of you Well, hell doesn't want you
And heaven is full
Bring me some water
Put it in this skull
I walk between the raindrops
I wait in Bug House square
And the army ants
They leave mothin' but the bones
Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
Dreaming of you There was thunder, there was lightning
Then the stars went out
And the moon fell from the sky
It rained mackerel, it rained trout
And the great day of wrath has come
And here's mud in your big red eye
And the poker's in the fire
And the locusts take the sky
Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming Well, the earth died screaming

Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
Dreaming of you
Well, dreaming of you
Well, dreaming of you
Well, dreaming of you My time went so quickly,
I went lickety-splickly
Out to my old '55
Pulled away slowly, feeling so holy,
God knows, I was feeling alive. And now the sun's coming up,
I'm riding with Lady Luck,
Freeway cars and trucks,
Stars beginning to fade,
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,
Oh, Lord, that the feeling's getting stronger. Now six in the morning, gave me no warning;
I had to be on my way.
Lights passing and trucks a flashing,
I'm on my way home from your place. And now the sun's coming up,
I'm riding with Lady Luck,
Freeway cars and trucks. I had a good home but I left
I had a good home but I left, right, left
That big fucking bomb made me deaf, deaf
A Humvee mechanic put his Kevlar on wrong
I guarantee you'll meet up with a suicide bomb
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce Big fucking ditches in the middle of the road
You pay a hundred dollars just for fillin' in the hole
Listen to the general every goddamn word
How many ways can you polish up a turd
Left, right, left, left, right
Left, right
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce How is it that the only ones responsible for making this mess
Got their sorry asses stapled to a goddamn desk
Hell broke luce

I was a chef, I was a chef
What was your name?
It was Geoff, Geoff
I lost my buddy and I wept, wept
I come down from the meth
So I slept, slept
I had a good home but I left, left Pantsed at the wind for a joke
I pranced right in with the dope
Glanced at her shin she said nope
Left, right, left Nimrod Bodfish have you any wool
Get me another body bag, the body bag's full
My face was scorched, scorched
I miss my home I miss my porch, porch

What the hell was it that the president said?
Give him a beautiful parade instead
Left, right, left When I was over here I never got to vote
I left my arm in my coat
My mom she died and never wrote
We sat by the fire and ate a goat
Just before he died he had a toke
Now I'm home and I'm blind
And I'm broke
What is next Sticks and stones will break my bones
But I always will be true
And when your mama is dead and gone
I'll sing this lullaby just for you
So what becomes of all the little boys
Who never comb their hair?
They're lined up all around the block
On The Nickel over there So you better bring a bucket
There is a hole in the pail
If you don't get my letter
Then you'll know that I'm in jail
So what becomes of all the little boys
Who never say their prayers?
They're sleepin' like a baby
On The Nickel over there If you chew tobacco, and wish upon a star
You'll find out where the scarecrows sit
Just like punchlines between the cars
I know a place where a royal flush
Can never beat a pair
And even Thomas Jefferson
Is On The Nickel over there So ring around the rosie, you're sleepin' in the rain
And you're always late for supper
And man you let me down, let me down again
I thought I heard a mockingbird, Roosevelt knows where
You can skip the light with grady tuck
On the Nickel over there So what becomes of all the little boys
Who run away from home?
The world just keeps gettin' bigger
Once you get out on your own
So what becomes of all the little boys
The sandman takes you where
You'll be sleepin' with a pillowman
On the Nickel over there So let's climb up through that button hole
And fall right up the stairs
I'll show you where the short dogs grow
On the Nickel over there All my friends are married
Every Tom and Dick and Harry
You must be strong
To go it alone
Here's to the bachelors
And the bowery bums
And those who feel that they're the ones
Who are better off without a wife
I like to sleep until the crack of noon
Midnight howlin' at the moon
Goin' out when I wanto, comin' home when I please
I don't have to ask permission
If I want to go out fishing
And I never have to ask for the keys
Never been no Valentino
Had a girl who lived in Reno
Left me for a trumpet player
Didn't get me down
He was wanted for assault
Though he said it weren't his fault
Well the coppers rode him right
Out of town
(chorus) selfish about my privacy
As long as I can be with me
We get along so well I can't believe
I love to chew the fat with folks
And listen to all your dirty jokes
I'm so thankful for these friends
I do receive
(chorus) Let's put a new coat of paint
On this lonesome old town
Set 'em up, we'll be knockin' 'em down
You wear a dress
Baby I'll a tie
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon
In that burgundy sky All our scribbled love dreams are lost or thrown away
Here amidst the shuffle of an overflowin' day
Our love needs a transfusion let's shoot it full of wine
Fishin' for a good time starts with throwin' in your line. So let's put a new coat of paint
On this lonesome old town
Set em' up, set em' up we'll be knockin' 'em down
You wear a dress baby
I'll wear a tie
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon
In that burgundy sky Inside a broken clock
Splashing the wine
With all the Rain Dogs
Taxi, we'd rather walk
Huddle a doorway with the Rain Dogs
For I am a Rain Dog, too Oh, how we danced and we swallowed the night
For it was all ripe for dreaming
Oh, how we danced away all of the lights
We've always been out of our minds The Rum pours strong and thin
Beat out the dustman
With the Rain Dogs
Aboard a shipwreck train
Give my umbrella to the Rain Dogs
For I am a Rain Dog, too Oh, how we danced with the Rose of Tralee
Her long hair black as a raven
Oh, how we danced and you whispered to me
You'll never be going back home Davenports and kettle drums
And swallowtail coats
Tablecloths and patent-leather shoes
Bathing suits and bowling balls
And clarinets and rings
And all this radio really needs is a fuse
A tinker, a tailor
A soldier's things
His rifle, his boots full of rocks
Oh, and this one is for bravery
And this one is for me
And everything's a dollar
In this box Cufflinks and hubcaps
Trophies and paperbacks
It's good transportation
But the brakes aren't so hot
Neckties and boxing gloves
This jackknife is rusted
You can pound that dent out on the hood
A tinker, a tailor
A soldier's things
His rifle, his boots full of rocks
Oh, and this one is for bravery
Oh, and this one is for me
And everything's a dollar
In this box Warm beer and cold women, I just don't fit in
Every joint I stumbled into tonight
That's just how it's been
All these double knit strangers with
Gin and vermouth and recycled stories
In the naugahyde booths
With the platinum blondes
And tobacco brunettes
I'll be drinkin' to forget you
Lite another cigarette
And the band's playin' something
By Tammy Wynette
And the drinks are on me tonight
All my conversations I'll just be
Talkin' about you baby
Borin' some sailor as I try to get through
I just want him to listen
That's all you have to do
He said I'm better off without you
Till I showed him my tattoo
Now the moon's rising
Ain't got no time to lose
Time to get down to drinking
Tell the band to play the blues
Drink's are on me, I'll buy another round
At the last ditch attempt saloon
Warm beer and cold women, I just don't fit in
Every joint I stumbled into tonight
That's just how it's been
All these double knit strangers with
Gin and vermouth and recycled stories
In the naugahyde booths
With the platinum blondes
And tobacco brunettes
I'll be drinking to forget you
Lite another cigarette
And the band's playing somethin'
By Johnnie Barnett

I don't want to grow up
Nothin' ever seems to turn out right
I don't want to grow up
How do you move in a world of fog
That's always changing things?
Makes me wish that I could be a dog
Well, when I see the price that you pay
I don't want to grow up
I don't ever want to be that way
I don't want to grow up Seems like folks turn into things they they'd never want
The only thing to live for is today I'm gonna put a hole in my T.V. set
I don't want to grow up
Open up the medicine chest
And I don't want to grow up
I don't want to have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't want to be filled with doubt
I don't want to be a good boy scout
I don't want to have to learn to count
I don't want to have the biggest amount
I don't want to grow up Well, when I see my parents fight
I don't want to grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't want to grow up
I'd rather say here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't want to live in a big old tomb on Grand Street, hoo She's my only true love
She's all that I think of, look here
In my wallet
That's her She grew up on a farm there
There's a place on my arm where I've written
Her name next to mine You see I just
Can't live without her
And I'm her only boy
And she grew up outside McHenry
In Johnsburg, Illinois Well I got a bad liver and broken heart, yeah,
I drunk me a river since you tore me apart
And I don't have a drinking problem, 'cept when I can't get a drink
And I wish you'd a-known her, we were quite a pair,
She was sharp as a razor and soft as a prayer
So welcome to the continuing saga, she was my better half, and I was just a dog
And so here am I slumped, I've been chipped and I've been chumped on my stool
So buy this fool some spirits and libations, it's these railroad station bars
And all these conductors and porters, and I'm all out of quarters
And this epitaph is the aftermath, yeah I choose my path, hey, come on, Kath,
He's a lawyer, he ain't the one for ya
No, the moon ain't romantic, it's intimidating as hell,
And some guy's trying to sell me a watch
And so I'll meet you at the bottom of a bottle of bargain Scotch
I got me a bottle and a dream, it's so maudlin it seems,
You can name your poison, go on ahead and make some noise
I ain't sentimental, this ain't a purchase, it's a rental, and it's purgatory,
And hey, what's your story, well I don't even care
Cause I got my own double-cross to bear And I'll see your Red Label, and I'll raise you one more,
And you can pour me a cab, I just can't drink no more,
Cause it don't douse the flames that are started by dames,
It ain't like asbestos
It don't do nothing but rest us assured,
And substantiate the rumors that you've heard Well, Jesus gonna be here
He's gonna be here soon
He's gonna cover us up with leaves
With a blanket from the moon
With a promise and a vow
And a lullaby for my brow
Jesus gonna be here
Gonna be here soon Well, I'm not gonna do nothing
I'm gonna wait here
I don't have to shout
I got no reason, yeah
And I got no doubt, yeah
I'm gonna get myself unfurled
From this mortal coiled-up world
Jesus gonna be here
Gonna be here soon I got to keep my eyes, keep 'em wide open
So I can see my Lord, yeah
I'm gonna watch the horizon
For my brand-new Ford, yeah Well, I can hear him rolling on down the lane
I said "Hollywood be thy name"
'Cause Jesus gonna be
He gonna be here soon, yeah Well I'm singing this song, cause it's time it was sung
I've been putting it off for a while,
Cause it's harder by now, and the truth is so clear
That I am crying when I'm seeing you smile.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone. And every time that I tried to tell you
that we'd lost the magic we had at the start,
I would weep my heart when I looked in your eyes
And I searched once again for the spark.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone. Oh you know that there's something calling me dear
and by morning, I'm sure to be gone
For I'm older than you and you know so well
That our time for to love was a song
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone. Now I can see by your eyes, it's time now to go
So I'll leave you crying in the rain,
Though I held in my hand, the key to all joy
Honey my heart was not born to be tamed.
And goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone. Well, you play that tarantella, all the hounds will start to roar
The boys all go to hell and then the Cubans hit the floor
They drive along the pipeline, they tango 'til they're sore
They take apart their nightmares and they leave them by the door
Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
And send me off to bed for evermore Make sure they play my theme song, I guess daisies will have to do
Just get me to New Orleans and paint shadows on the pews
Turn the spit on that pig and kick the drum and let me down
Put my clarinet beneath your bed till I get back in town
Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
So send me off to bed for evermore Just make sure she's all in calico and the color of a doll
Wave the flag on Cadillac day, and a skillet on the wall
Cut me a switch or hold your breath 'til the sun goes down
Write my name on the hood, send me off to another town
And just let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or Better on a blanket by the stairs
Tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
Will you send me off to bed for evermore? Fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
Send me off to bed for evermore
Send me off to bed for evermore As you go out it's Independence Day
But instead I'll just pour myself a drink
It's got to be love, I've never felt this way
Oh baby, this one's from the heart The shadows in the road look like a railroad track
I wonder if he's (ever) really comin' back
The moon's a yellow stain across the sky
Oh baby, this one's from the heart (Maybe) And I'll go down to the corner and get a racin' form
(But) And I should probably wait here by the phone
And the brakes need adjustment on the convertible
Oh baby, this one's from the heart The worm is climbin' the other color tree
Robin is back against the wall
Pour myself a double sympathy
Oh baby, this one's from the heart Blonde's, brunettes, and redheads put their hammer down
(To put ) don't pound a cold chisel through my heart
But they were nothin' but apostrophes
O baby, this one's from the heart I can't tell, is that a siren or a saxophone
But the roads get so slippery (when it rains)
I love you more than all these words can ever say
Oh baby, this one's from the heart Well, you play that tarantella, all the hounds will start to roar
The boys all go to hell and then the Cubans hit the floor
They drive along the pipeline, they tango 'til they're sore
They take apart their nightmares and they leave them by the door
Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
And send me off to bed for evermore Make sure they play my theme song, I guess daisies will have to do
Just get me to New Orleans and paint shadows on the pews
Turn the spit on that pig and kick the drum and let me down
Put my clarinet beneath your bed till I get back in town
Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
So send me off to bed for evermore Just make sure she's all in calico and the color of a doll
Wave the flag on Cadillac day, and a skillet on the wall
Cut me a switch or hold your breath 'til the sun goes down
Write my name on the hood, send me off to another town
And just let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or Better on a blanket by the stairs
Tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
Will you send me off to bed for evermore? Fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
Send me off to bed for evermore
Send me off to bed for evermore You're the head on the spear
You're the nail on the cross
You're the fly in my beer
You're the key that got lost
You're the letter from Jesus on the bathroom wall
You're Mother Superior with only a bra
You're the same kind of bad as me
You're the same kind of bad as me I'm the hat on the bed
I'm the coffee instead
The fish or cut bait
I'm the detective up late
I'm the blood on the floor
The thunder and the roar
I'm the boat that won't sink
I just won't sleep a wink
You're the same kind of bad as me
You're the same kind of bad as me
You're the same kind of bad as me
You're the same kind of bad as me No good you say
Well that's good enough for me You're the wreath that caught fire
You're the preach to the choir
You bite down on the sheet
But your teeth have been wired
You skid in the rain
You're trying to shift
You're grinding the gears
You're trying to shift
And you're the same kind of bad as me
You're the same kind of bad as me
She's the same kind of bad as me
You're the same kind of bad as me They told me you were no good
I know you'll take care of all my needs
You're the same kind of bad as me I'm the mattress in the back
I'm the old gunnysack
I'm the one with the gun
Most likely to run
I'm the car in the weeds
If you cut me I'll bleed
You're the same kind of bad as me
You're the same kind of bad as me
Same kind of bad as me
You're the same kind of bad as me
You're the same kind of bad as me Uno, dos, tres, quatro
Same kind of bad as me I'm leavin' my fam'ly
And leavin' my friends
My body's at home
But my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines
On a new front page sky
My tears are salt water
And the moon's full and high And I know Martin Eden's
Gonna be proud of me
And many before me
Who've been called by the sea
To be up in the crow's nest
And singin' my say
Shiver me Timbers
Cause I'm a-sailin' away The fog's liftin'
And the sand's shiftin'
And I'm driftin' on out
And Ol' Captain Ahab
He ain't got nothin' on me.
So come on and swallow me, don't follow me
I'm trav'lin' alone
Blue water's my daughter
'N I'm gonna skip like a stone So please call my missus
Tell her not to cry
Cause my goodbye is written
By the moon in the sky
And nobody knows me
I can't fathom my stayin'
Shiver me timbers
I'm a-sailin' away And the fog's liftin'
And the sand's shiftin'
I'm driftin' on out
Ol' Captain Ahab
He ain't got nothin' on me
So come on and swallow me, don't follow me
I'm trav'lin' alone
Blue water's my daughter
'N I'm gonna skip like a stone And I'm leavin' my family
Leavin' my friends
My body's at home
But my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines
On a new front page sky
And shiver me timbers
I'm a-sailin' away Old boyfriends
Lost in the pocket of your overcoat
Like burned out light bulbs on a Ferris wheel
Old boyfriends You remember the kinds of cars they drove
Parking in an orange grove
He fell in love, you see
With someone that I used to be Though I very seldom think of him
Nevertheless sometimes a mannequin's
Blue summer dress can make the window like a dream
Ah, but now those dreams belong to someone else
Now they talk in their sleep in a drawer where I keep all my Old boyfriends
Remember when you were burning for them
Why do you keep turning them into
Old boyfriends They look you up when they're in town
To see if they can still burn you down
He fell in love, you see
With someone that I used to be Though I very seldom think of him
Nevertheless sometimes a mannequin's
Blue summer dress can make the window like a dream
Ah, but now those dreams belong to someone else
Now they talk in their sleep in a drawer where I keep all my Old boyfriends
Turn up every time it rains
Fall out of the pages in a magazine
Old boyfriends Girls fill up the bars every spring
Dark places for remembering
Old boyfriends
All my old boyfriends
Old boyfriends It's more than rain that falls on our parade tonight
It's more than thunder it's more than thunder
And it's more than a bad dream now that I'm sober
Nothing but sad times, nothing but sad times
None of our pockets are lined with gold
Nobody's caught the bouquet
There are no dead presidents we can fold
Nothing is going our way
And it's more than trouble I've got myself into
It's more than woebegotten grey skies now And it's more than a bad dream now that I'm sober
There's no more dancing, there's no more dancing
And it's more than trouble I've got myself into
Nothing but sad times, nothing but sad times
None of our pockets are lined with gold
Nobody's caught the bouquet
There are no dead presidents we can fold
Nothing is going our way
And it's more than goodbye, I have to say to you
It's more than woebegotten grey skies now
And it's more than goodbye, I have to say to you
It's more than woebegotten grey skies now
And it's more than woebegotten grey skies now Outside another yellow moon
Has punched a hole in the nighttime, yes
I climb through the window and down the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
With all those Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds Well, you wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now? Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train?
Every night it's just the same
You leave me lonely, now I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four-way
You watch them as the fall
Oh baby, they all have heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train?
Every night it's just the same
Oh, baby Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train?
All of my dreams just fall like rain
Oh, baby, on a downtown train Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train?
Every night, every night it's just the same
Oh, baby Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train?
All of my dreams just fall like rain
Well, on a downtown train Well, on a downtown train
Well, on a downtown train
Well, on a downtown train
On a downtown train If you want money in your pocket
And a top hat on your head
A hot meal on your table
And a blanket on your bed Well today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here Well, I'm going to New York City
And I'm leaving on a train
And if you want to stay behind
And wait til I come back again Today's grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday's here If you want to go
Where rainbows end
You'll have to say goodbye
All our dreams come true, baby up ahead
And it's out where your memories lie Well, the road is out before me
And the moon is shining bright
What I want you to remember as I disappear tonight Well, today's grey skies
Tomorrow's tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here Well, today's grey skies
Tomorrow's tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday's here
You'll have to wait til yesterday's here
You'll have to wait til yesterday's here Mamas in the kitchen, Daddies on the phone
And nobody knows what's going on
But I've got those
So long I'll see you cause my Buick's outside waiting blues Well one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, Tom's gotta go
He's got them
So long I'll see you cause my Buick's outside waiting blues Well bye-bye-bye, well bye-bye-bye
Sing bye-bye Shooby-do-bye-bye
Gotta skeet-skat outta here, skeet-skat outta here And mamas in the kitchen, daddies on the phone
And nobody knows what's going on
But I've got those
So long I'll see you cause my Buick's outside waiting blues Well, they're lining up to mad-dog your Tilt-a-Whirl
Three shots for a dollar, win a real live doll
All the lies that you tell, I believed them so well
Take them back, take them back to your red house
For that fearful leap into the dark
Oh well, I did my time in the jail of your arms
Now Ophelia wants to know where she should turn Tell me, what did you do?
What did you do the last time, why don't you do that?
Well, go on ahead and take this the wrong way
Time's not your friend
Do you cry, do you pray, do you wish them away?
Are you still leaving nothing but bones in the way?
Did you bury the carnival, with the lions and all?
Excuse me while I sharpen my nails And just who are you, who are you this time?
You look rather tired, are you pretending to love?
Well, I hear that it pays well
How do your pistol and your Bible and your sleeping pills go?
Are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes?
Well, I fell in love with your sailor's mouth and your wounded eyes
You better get down on the floor, don't you know this is war?
Tell me, who are you this time?
Tell me, who are you this time? The broken glass
And the rusty nails
Where the violets grow
Say goodbye to the railroad
And the mad dogs of summer
And everything that I know What some men will do here for diamonds
What some men will do here for gold
Wounded but they just keep on climbin'
Sleep by the side of the road There's a hole in the ladder
A fence we can climb
Mad as a hatter
You're thin as a dime
Go out to the meadow
The hills are agreen
Sing me a rainbow
Steal me a dream Small-time Napoleons
Shattered his knees
But he stays in the saddle for Rose
And all his disciples
They shave in the gutter
And gather what's left of his clothers Now you're gone, it's hotels and whiskey and sad-luck dames
And I don't care if they miss me, I never remember their names
They say if you get far enough away, you'll be on your way back home
Well, I'm at the station, and I can't get on the train Must be blind love
Only kind of love is stone blind love
Blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
Oh, it's blind love
Stone blind love
It's your stone blind love Now the street's turning blue, the dogs are barking and the night has come
And there's tears that are falling from your blue eyes now
I wonder where you are
And I whisper your name
The only way to find you is if I close my eyes I'll find you with my blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
Oh, your blind love
Your stone blind love Blow wind blow, wherever you may go
Put on your overcoat, take me away
You gotta take me on into the night
Take me on into the night
Blow me away, blow me away Mary's on the black top
There's a husband in the dog house
In the middle of a shakedown
I got quiet as a churchmouse
Put my Raleighs on the dashboard
Sugar daddy caught a polo-car
There's no solitary tap dance way down here Blow wind blow, wherever you may go
Put on your overcoat, take me into the night
Take me into the night, blow me away I ride upon a field mouse
I was dancin' in the slaughterhouse
And it was swing along the beltway
You skid along there all day
'Cause I went a little crazy
And I sat upon a high chair
And I'm smokin like a diesel way out here She wore red shoes by the drugstore
As the rain splashed the nickel
Spilled like chablis along the midway
There's a little blue jay
In a red dress, on a sad night
One straw in a root beer
A compact with a cracked mirror
And a bottle of evening in Paris perfume
He told her to wait in by the magazines
He had to take care of some business it seems
Bring a raincoat and a suitcase
And your dark eyes
And wear those red shoes
There's a dark huddle at the bus stop
Umbrellas arranged in a sad bouquet
Li'l Caesar got caught
He was going down to second
He was cooled
Changing stations on the chamber
To steal a diamond
From a jewelry store for his baby
He loved the way she looked in those red shoes
She waited by the drugstore
Caesar had never been this late before
And the dogs bayed the moon
And rattled their chains
And the cold jingle of taps in a puddle
Was the burglar alarm
Snitchin' on Caesar
Now the rain washes memories from the sidewalks
And the hounds splash down the nickel
Full of soldiers
And Santa Claus is drunk in the ski room
And it's Christmas eve in a sad cafe
When the moon gets this way
There's a little blue jay
By the newsstand
Wearing red shoes
So meet me tonight by the drugstore
We're goin' out tonight
Wear your red shoes Mocking Bird high in a tree
Looks like you got the best of me
Mocking Bird singing his song
Well Mocking Bird mocking me
Now that you're gone Mocking Bird high in a loof
Well he's blowing notes on top my roof
Mocking Bird singing his song
Well Mocking Bird mocking me
Now that you're gone. Mocking Bird high in a tree
Looking up at you, you're looking down at me
Mocking Bird high in a loof
Well he's blowing notes on top my roof. Mocking Bird high in a tree
Looking up at you, you're looking down at me
Mocking Bird singing his song
Well Mocking Bird mocking me
Now that you're gone. Throwed some papers, tried to scare him away
Just looked down at me and this is what he said Mocking Bird high in a tree
Looks like you got the best of me
Mocking Bird singing his song
Well Mocking Bird mocking me
Now that you're gone Well I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn
Nobody's up except the moon and me,
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree
All that you left me was a melody.
Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie,
How can I persuade? Rosie And the moon's all up, full and big,
Apricot tips in an indigo sky,
And I've been loving you, Rosie,
Since the day I was born
And I'll love you, Rosie 'til the day I die.
Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie,
How can I persuade? Rosie Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie,
How can I persuade? Rosie And I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn
Nobody's up except the moon and me,
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree
All that you left me was a melody.
Rosie, why do you evade?
Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie
